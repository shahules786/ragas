## MultiModalFaithfulness

`MultiModalFaithfulness` metric measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against both visual and textual context. It is calculated from the answer, retrieved textual context, and visual context. The answer is scaled to a (0,1) range, with higher scores indicating better faithfulness.

The generated answer is regarded as faithful if all the claims made in the answer can be inferred from either the visual or textual context provided. To determine this, the response is directly evaluated against the provided contexts, and the faithfulness score is either 0 or 1.

### Example

```python
from ragas.database_schema import SingleTurnSample 
from ragas.metrics import MultiModalFaithfulness

sample = SingleTurnSample(
        user_input="What about the Tesla Model X?",
        response="Cats are cute.",
        retrieved_contexts=[
            "custom_eval/multimodal/images/tesla.jpg"
        ]
    )
scorer = MultiModalFaithfulness()
await scorer.single_turn_ascore(sample)
```

### How Itâ€™s Calculated 

!!! example
    **Question**: What about the Tesla Model X?

    **Context (visual)**: 
    - An image of the Tesla Model X (custom_eval/multimodal/images/tesla.jpg)

    **High faithfulness answer**: The Tesla Model X is an electric SUV manufactured by Tesla.

    **Low faithfulness answer**: Cats are cute.

Let's examine how faithfulness was calculated using the low faithfulness answer:

- **Step 1:** Evaluate the generated response against the given contexts.
    - Response: "Cats are cute."

- **Step 2:** Verify if the response can be inferred from the given context.
    - Response: No

- **Step 3:** Use the result to determine the faithfulness score.

    $$
    \text{Faithfulness} = 0
    $$

In this example, the response "Cats are cute" cannot be inferred from the image of the Tesla Model X, so the faithfulness score is 0.
