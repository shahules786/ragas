# Summarization Score

This metric gives a measure of how well the `summary` captures the important information from the `contexts`. The intuition behind this metric is that a good summary shall contain all the important information present in the context(or text so to say).

We first extract a set of important keyphrases from the context. These keyphrases are then used to generate a set of questions. The answers to these questions are always `yes(1)` for the context. We then ask these questions to the summary and calculate the summarization score as the ratio of correctly answered questions to the total number of questions. 

We compute the question-answer score using the answers, which is a list of `1`s and `0`s. The question-answer score is then calculated as the ratio of correctly answered questions(answer = `1`) to the total number of questions.

```{math}
:label: question-answer-score
\text{QA score} = \frac{|\text{correctly answered questions}|}{|\text{total questions}|}
````

We also introduce an option to penalize larger summaries by proving a conciseness score. If this option is enabled, the final score is calculated as the average of the summarization score and the conciseness score. This conciseness scores ensures that summaries that are just copies of the text do not get a high score, because they will obviously answer all questions correctly.

```{math}
:label: conciseness-score
\text{conciseness score} = 1 - \frac{\text{length of summary}}{\text{length of context}}
````

The final summarization score is then calculated as:

```{math}
:label: summarization-score
\text{Summarization Score} = \frac{\text{QA score} + \text{conciseness score}}{2}
````
