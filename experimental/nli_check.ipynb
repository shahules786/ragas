      "explanation: the context states that the adult human body averaged ~65% water, but this varied substantially by age, sex, and adiposity (amount of fat in body composition). the figure for water fraction by weight in this sample was found to be 58 ±8% water for males and 48 ±6% for females. so answer is no.\n",
      "3. infants contain as much as 75% water while elderly bodies contain only around 45%.\n",
      "explanation: the context states that the body water constitutes as much as 75% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight. so answer is yes.\n",
      "4. body water is important for digestion, absorption, circulation, saliva production, nutrient transportation, and temperature maintenance.\n",
      "explanation: the context states that water in the animal body performs a number of functions: as a solvent for transportation of nutrients; as a medium for excretion; a means for heat control; as a lubricant for joints; and for shock absorption. so answer is yes.\n",
      "5. it is important to stay hydrated by regularly drinking fluids throughout the day.\n",
      "explanation: the context states that the usual way of adding water to a body is by drinking. so answer is yes.\n",
