4,Question: What is theranostics and how does it combine diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in precision medicine?,"[""Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is an emerging field in precision medicine that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide the potential for personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments. Improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies are the basis of the field of theragnostics. For some conditions, medical imaging has enabled non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. When medical imaging is coupled with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics may provide opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself. Techniques such as image-guided radiotherapy, FDG PET for therapy assessment, and molecular-targeted therapies guided by oncogene expression analysis exemplify the integration of diagnostics and therapeutics. Nuclear medicine has played a significant role in the development of these methods, and recent advancements in nanotechnology, specifically nanomedicine, have expanded the therapeutic potential of radiodiagnostics beyond interventional radiology.\n\nApplications\nNuclear medicine\nTheranostics originated in the field of nuclear medicine; iodine isotope 131 for the diagnostic study and treatment of thyroid cancer was one of its earliest applications. Nuclear medicine encompasses various substances, either alone or in combination, that can be used for diagnostic imaging and targeted therapy. These substances may include ligands of receptors present on the target tissue or compounds, like iodine, that are internalized by the target through metabolic processes. By utilizing these mechanisms, theranostics enables the localization of pathological tissues with imaging and the targeted destruction of these tissues using high doses of radiation.\n\nRadiological scope\nContrast agents with therapeutic properties have been under development for several years, although they are not yet in clinical use as of 2021. One example is the design of contrast agents capable of releasing a chemotherapeutic agent locally at the target site, triggered by a stimulus provided by the operator. This localized approach aims to increase treatment efficacy and minimize side effects. For instance, ultrasound-based contrast media, such as microbubbles, can accumulate in hypervascularized tissues and release the active ingredient in response to ultrasound waves, thus targeting a specific area chosen by the sonographer. Another approach involves linking monoclonal antibodies (capable of targeting different molecular targets) to nanoparticles. This strategy enhances the drug's affinity and specificity towards the target and enables visualization of the treatment area, such as using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles detectable by magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, these particles can be designed to release chemotherapy agents specifically at the site of binding, producing a local synergistic effect with antibody action. Integrating these methods with medical-nuclear techniques, which offer greater imaging sensitivity, can aid in target identification and treatment monitoring.\n\nImaging techniques\nPositron emission tomography\nPositron emission tomography (PET) imaging in theranostics provides insight into metabolic and molecular processes within the body. The PET scanner detects  photons and creates three-dimensional images that enable visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes. PET imaging utilizes radiotracers that target specific molecules or processes. For example, [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is commonly used to assess glucose metabolism, as cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake. Other radiotracers target specific receptors, enzymes, or transporters, allowing the evaluation of various physiological and pathological processes.In theranostics, PET imaging plays a role in both diagnosis and treatment planning. It aids in the identification and staging of diseases, such as cancer, by visualizing the extent and metabolic activity of tumors. PET scans can also guide treatment decisions by assessing treatment response and monitoring disease progression. Additionally, PET imaging is utilized to determine the suitability of patients for targeted therapies based on specific molecular characteristics, enabling personalized treatment approaches.\n\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is employed in theranostics, utilizing gamma rays emitted by a radiotracer to generate three-dimensional images of the body. SPECT imaging involves the injection of a radiotracer that emits single photons, which are detected by a gamma camera rotating around the patient.SPECT provides functional and anatomical information, allowing the assessment of organ structure, blood flow, and specific molecular targets. It is useful in evaluating diseases that involve altered blood flow or specific receptor expression. For example, SPECT imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) radiopharmaceuticals can assess myocardial perfusion and identify areas of ischemia or infarction in patients with cardiovascular diseases.In theranostics, SPECT imaging helps in identifying disease localization, staging, and assessing the response to therapy. Moreover, SPECT imaging is employed in targeted radionuclide therapy, where the same radiotracer used for diagnostic imaging can be utilized to deliver therapeutic doses of radiation to the diseased tissue.\n\nMagnetic resonance imagine\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that utilizes strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to generate detailed anatomical and functional images of the body. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and is widely used in theranostics for its ability to visualize anatomical structures and assess physiological processes.In theranostics, MRI allows for the detection and characterization of tumors, assessment of tumor extent, and evaluation of treatment response. MRI can provide information on tissue perfusion, diffusion, and metabolism, aiding in the selection of appropriate therapies and monitoring their effectiveness.Advancements in MRI technology have further expanded its capabilities in theranostics. Techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) enable the assessment of brain activation and connectivity, while diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides insights into tissue microstructure. The development of molecular imaging agents, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, allows for targeted imaging and tracking of specific molecular entities.\n\nTherapeutic approaches\nTheranostics encompasses a range of therapeutic approaches that are designed to target and treat diseases with enhanced precision.\n\nTargeted drug delivery systems\nTargeted drug delivery systems in theranostics facilitate the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to specific disease sites while minimizing off-target effects. These systems employ strategies, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, to encapsulate drugs and enhance their stability, solubility, and bioavailability. By incorporating diagnostic components, such as imaging agents or targeting ligands, into these delivery systems, clinicians can monitor drug distribution and accumulation in real-time, ensuring effective treatment and reducing systemic toxicity. Targeted drug delivery systems hold promise in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions, as they allow for personalized and site-specific therapy.\n\nGene therapy\nGene therapy is a therapeutic approach that involves modifying or replacing faulty genes to treat or prevent diseases.""]","Answer: Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is an emerging field in precision medicine that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide the potential for personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments.

15,"Question: When did Pope Benedict XVI become the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State, and when did he resign?","['Pope Benedict XVI (Latin: Benedictus PP. XVI; Italian: Benedetto XVI; German: Benedikt XVI; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger; 16 April 1927 – 31 December 2022) was the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 19 April 2005 until his resignation on 28 February 2013. Benedict\'s election as pope occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until he was elected pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Before becoming pope, he had been ""a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century""; he had had an influence ""second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions"" as one of John Paul II\'s closest confidants.Benedict\'s writings were prolific and generally defended traditional Catholic doctrine, values, and liturgy. He was originally a liberal theologian but adopted conservative views after 1968. During his papacy, Benedict advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries. He viewed relativism\'s denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century. Benedict also revived several traditions, including the Tridentine Mass. He strengthened the relationship between the Catholic Church and art, promoted the use of Latin, and reintroduced traditional papal vestments, for which reason he was called ""the pope of aesthetics"". He was described as ""the main intellectual force in the Church"" since the mid-1980s.On 11 February 2013, Benedict announced his resignation, citing a ""lack of strength of mind and body"" due to his advanced age. His resignation was the first by a pope since Gregory XII in 1415, and the first on a pope\'s initiative since Celestine V in 1294. He was succeeded by Francis on 13 March 2013 and moved into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in Vatican City for his retirement.']","Answer: Pope Benedict XVI became the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State on April 19, 2005.

16,"Question: What caused the crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal?","['Yeti Airlines Flight 691 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara in Nepal. On 15 January 2023, the aircraft being operated on the route, an ATR 72 flown by Yeti Airlines, crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 occupants on board. It is the deadliest accident involving an ATR 72.\n\nAccident\nThe flight took off from Kathmandu\'s Tribhuvan International Airport at 10:33 am NST. It crashed on the bank of the Seti Gandaki River while on final approach to landing at Pokhara International Airport. A video filmed from the ground showed the aircraft banking steeply to the left before crashing 65 metres (213 ft) away. Another video was streamed live on Facebook by Sonu Jaiswal, a passenger on the plane, before and during the crash. The video shows passengers unaware of the situation until seconds before impact.The crash occurred in Gandaki Province between the old Pokhara Airport and the new Pokhara International Airport, which was opened two weeks earlier and also where the aircraft was intending to land. The accident resulted in the deaths of all 72 people on board, and was Nepal\'s worst aviation accident since the crash of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 268 in 1992, the deadliest aviation accident in Nepalese domestic aviation, and the deadliest accident involving an ATR 72.According to an official at the Pokhara International Airport, air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 30 heading from east to west, but the captain requested the opposing runway 12 heading from west to east, minutes before the crash. A Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal spokesperson said: ""The weather was clear; according to preliminary information the cause of the crash is the technical issue of the plane.""Flight-tracking organisation Flightradar24 noted that during the flight the aircraft had been transmitting inaccurate speed and altitude data.\n\nAftermath\nThe airport was closed as authorities launched a rescue operation. The Government of Nepal summoned an emergency cabinet meeting following the crash. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was deeply saddened by the tragic accident. The Office of the Prime Minister declared 16 January to be a national day of mourning, and the flag of Nepal was flown at half-staff. Yeti Airlines cancelled all regular flights scheduled for the day.\n\nInvestigation\nExperts noted that the video from the ground taken moments before the crash showed the aircraft\'s nose noticeably high before the left wing suddenly dropped, probably indicating a stall. Hours after the crash, a five-member committee headed by Nagendra Ghimire was set up to investigate the accident in conjunction with the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety.\nOn 16 January, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were found; the recorders were examined in Singapore and with assistance from Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, and Transport Safety Investigation Bureau of Singapore. About a month later, on 13 February, a preliminary report was released, which largely reproduced all relevant logs:At 10:56:27, the PF disengaged the Autopilot System (AP) at an altitude of 721 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The PF then called for ""FLAPS 30"" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, ""Flaps 30 and descending"". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap surface movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition...\nThe flight crew then carried out the ""Before Landing Checklist"" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At the point, Np of both propellers were recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines were at 0%. When propellers are in feather, they are not producing thrust...\nAt 10:56:54, another click was heard, followed by the flaps surface movement to the 30 degrees position.\n\nWhen ATC gave the clearance for landing at 10:57:07, the PF mentioned twice that there was no power coming from the engines. At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. At 10:57:20, the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines...\nThe aircraft\'s propellers had been feathered for a minute prior to the crash, causing the engine to produce no thrust and lead the vehicle into a stall; the condition levers, which control the propellers, were discovered from the wreckage set to the feathered position. Seconds preceding the crash, the pilots discussed a total lack of power and even moved the power lever to the extreme but failed to recognize that the condition levers were wrongly set. That the condition levers and the flap lever are next to each other in an ATR 72, experts speculate that the monitoring pilot (Kamal KC) had inadvertently moved the former in place of the latter, when asked of by the flying pilot; while, about twenty seconds later, he would set the flap lever properly on his own, he failed to account for his previous mistake, implying that the landing checklist was not properly followed.']","Answer: The crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal was caused by a technical issue with the plane. According to a spokesperson from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the weather was clear at the time of the crash, and preliminary information suggests that the crash was due to a technical problem. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders were recovered and examined, and a preliminary report indicated that the propellers of the aircraft had been feathered, causing the engines to produce no thrust and leading the plane into a stall. It was also noted that the power levers and condition levers were incorrectly set, possibly due to a mistake during the landing checklist. The investigation into the crash was conducted by a committee in Nepal, with assistance from the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, and the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau of Singapore.",1.0,0.16666666666666666,0.9700600467520092
17,Question: How does the height and thrust of the Starship rocket compare to other rockets?,"['Starship is a super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. At 120 metres (394 feet) in height and with a liftoff mass of 5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 pounds), Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, surpassing the thrust of NASA\'s Space Launch System and Saturn V, as well as the Soviet N1, which had previously held the record.The two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle consists of the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the second-stage spacecraft also named Starship. Both stages are powered by Raptor rocket engines, which burn liquid methane and liquid oxygen, operating in a full-flow staged combustion power cycle. Both are designed to be fully reusable, performing controlled landings on the arms of the launch tower used to lift the vehicles and, eventually, reflown within hours. Starship is designed to have a payload capacity of 150 tonnes (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in a fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) when expended. Starship vehicles in low Earth orbit are planned to be refilled with propellant launched in tanker Starships to enable transit to higher energy destinations such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars.Plans for a heavy-lift vehicle at SpaceX date to 2005, with the earliest concept resembling the modern vehicle announced in 2016. SpaceX\'s Starship development follows an iterative and incremental approach involving frequent, and often destructive, test flights of prototype vehicles. The first and so far only orbital test flight was attempted on 20 April 2023, when an anomaly caused the vehicle to tumble out of control four minutes after launch. SpaceX activated the flight termination system, which fired the explosive charges but did not destroy the vehicle. Approximately 40 seconds later both stages were destroyed due to increased aerodynamic forces.  After the test, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the launch program pending results of a standard ""mishap investigation"".SpaceX intends Starship to become its primary launch vehicle, superseding the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as the Dragon 2 spacecraft currently used as part of NASA\'s commercial crew program to the International Space Station. Starship is often coupled with the company\'s Mars ambitions. Planned Starship flights include the development of SpaceX\'s Starlink internet constellation, crewed flights under the Polaris and dearMoon programs, and two crewed lunar landings with a modified Starship spacecraft under the Artemis program.\n\nHistory\nStarting with a 2012 announcement of plans to develop a rocket with substantially greater capabilities than SpaceX\'s existing Falcon 9—underpinned by the ambition to enable human exploration and settlement of Mars—the company created a succession of preliminary designs for such a vehicle, under various names (Mars Colonial Transporter, Interplanetary Transport System, BFR) leading up to a 2019 adoption of a stainless-steel body design, which is also when the name changed to the current Starship. SpaceX has since been applying the iterative design methodology, using intensive tests on a series of rocket prototypes. The first prototype, Starhopper, performed several static fires and low-altitude flights. Seven of Starship\'s upper-stage prototypes were flight tested between August 2020 and May 2021. The last of the seven, a full-size Starship SN15, successfully landed after reaching an altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). A full-scale orbital test flight of the rocket took place on April 20, 2023.\n\nEarly design proposals\nIn 2007, Elon Musk publicly stated that he hopes to enable the exploration and settlement of Mars through SpaceX. SpaceX began developing the Raptor rocket engine before 2014. From 2011 to 2014, Musk made various statements expressing his hope that SpaceX would send humans to Mars in the 2020s to 2030s.\n\nMars Colonial Transporter\nIn October 2012, Musk made the first public articulation of plans to develop a fully reusable rocket system with substantially greater capabilities than SpaceX\'s existing Falcon 9. This new launch vehicle was intended to be part of the company\'s Mars system architecture, then known as the Mars Colonial Transporter/Mass Cargo Transport (MCT). According to SpaceX, the MCT system would include reusable rocket engines, launch vehicles and space capsules that would enable transportation of humans to Mars and back to Earth. SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell gave a potential payload range between 150-200 tonnes to low Earth orbit for the planned rocket. According to SpaceX, the MCT was to be ""going to be much bigger [than Falcon 9]"". In February 2014, the planned principal payload for the MCT was announced to be a large interplanetary spacecraft, designed to carry up to 100 tonnes (220,000 lb) of passengers and cargo. According to SpaceX engine development head Tom Mueller, SpaceX could use nine Raptor engines on a single spacecraft. The preliminary rocket design was to be at least 10 meters (33 ft) in diameter and was expected to have up to three cores totaling at least 27 booster engines.\n\nInterplanetary Transport System\nIn 2016, Musk changed the name of the Mars Colonial Transporter system to the Interplanetary Transport System  (ITS), as he intended for the system to be capable of traveling beyond Mars. That same year he provided more details about the space mission architecture, launch vehicle, spacecraft, and Raptor engines. The ITS stack was to be composed of two stages, both powered by Raptor engines. A first stage booster, and a second stage that was to be either an ""Interplanetary Spaceship"" for crewed transport or an ""ITS tanker"" for orbital refueling. By that point, Raptor was a rocket engine in a full flow staged combustion cycle, with liquid methane fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. Both propellants enter the combustion chamber completely in the gas phase. A bleed-off of the high-pressure gas would provide autogenous pressurization of the propellant tanks, eliminating the Falcon 9\'s problematic high-pressure helium pressurization system.The overall launch vehicle height, (first and second stages), was to be 122 m (400 ft). Both stages were to have been constructed of carbon fiber, including the cryogenic propellant tanks, a major change for SpaceX from the Falcon 9\'s aluminum-lithium alloy tank and structure material. Both stages were to be fully reusable and were to land vertically. The ITS booster was to be a 12 m-diameter (39 ft), 77.5 m-high (254 ft), reusable first stage powered by 42 engines, each producing 3,024 kilonewtons (680,000 lbf) of thrust. Total booster thrust would have been about 128 MN (29,000,000 lbf) at liftoff, several times the 36 MN (8,000,000 lbf) thrust of the Saturn V. The engine configuration included 21 engines in an outer ring and 14 in an inner ring. The center cluster of seven engines was to be gimbaled for directional control, although some directional control  was to be performed via differential thrust on the fixed engines. ']","Answer: The Starship rocket has a height of 120 meters (394 feet), making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. It surpasses the thrust of NASA's Space Launch System, Saturn V, and the Soviet N1, which previously held the record.

Its name means Red Sand in Turkic languages. It is located in Central Asia, in the land between the confluent rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, a region historically known as Transoxania. Today it is divided between Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It covers about 298,000 km2 (115,000 sq mi).\n\nGeography\nThe territory consists mainly of an extensive plain at an altitude up to 300 m (980 ft) above sea level, with a number of depressions and highlands (Sultanuizdag, Bukantau). Temperatures can be very high during the summer months, from mid-May to mid-September. Kerki, one extreme inland city located on the banks of the Amu Darya River, recorded 52 °C (126 °F) in July 1983. It is mainly located in Uzbekistan.\n\nFauna\nDesert fauna include the Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii) and a large lizard known as the Transcaspian or desert monitor (Varanus griseus), which can reach lengths of 1.6 m (5.2 ft). The saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) also occasionally migrates through the northern part of the desert.\nKyzylkum Nature Reserve in Bukhara Region was established in 1971. The total area of this reserve is 51,450 km2 (19,860 sq mi). It is a breeding centre for rare species such as goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), Przewalski\'s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), Turkmenian kulan (Equus hemionus kulan) and MacQueen\'s bustard (Chlamydotis macqueenii). The reserve was founded in 1977 on the enclosed area in 5,131 ha (19.81 sq mi).\n\nPaleontology\nThe Kyzylkum Desert has exposed rock formations that have yielded a number of fossils.  Of particular interest is the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, from the early Late Cretaceous, which has produced several species of early birds: Incolornis martini, Explorornis walkeri, Kizylkumavis cretacea, Kuszholia mengi, Lenesornis kaskarovi, Sazavis prisca, Zhyraornis kaskarovi and Z. logunovi are recognized as valid species. Tyrannosaurid, therizinosaurid, ornithomimosaur, oviraptorosaurian, troodontid, ankylosaur, hadrosaur, and ceratopsian dinosaurs are also known from this rock unit. Other fossils from the Cretaceous rocks of the Kyzylkum include tree trunks, pelecypods, beetles, sharks, rays, bony fish, frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs, and a varied fauna of small early mammals. The desert is well known for its deposits of gold, uranium, copper, aluminium and silver, natural gas and oil. The development of the most famous gold-field at Muruntau began in the early 1970s.

Thomas Cheeseman described the species in 1906. Plants of this species of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes with ebracteate inflorescences and white corollas with stamens that are wholly exserted.\n\nTaxonomy and etymology\nMyosotis angustata Cheeseman is in the plant family Boraginaceae. It was originally described by New Zealand botanist Thomas Cheeseman in his Manual of the New Zealand Flora in 1906. The most recent treatment of this species was done by Lucy B. Moore in the Flora of New Zealand.The original specimens (syntypes) of this species were collected by Cheeseman in ""Mt Arthur Plateau and Raglan Mountains"", South Island, New Zealand. The specimens collected by Cheeseman are housed at the herbarium of the Auckland War Memorial Museum (AK).\nCheeseman noted that M. angustata is morphologically very similar to M. traversii, and made the following distinction between the two species:""Short, stout, densely hispid, 2–6 in. high. Leaves linear-spathulate. Racemes short, capitate. Flowers 1/4–1/3 in. long, lemon-yellow. Filaments very short, the tip of the anthers just above the scales....................10. M.

Within the southern hemisphere lineage, species relationships, including those of the two individual sequenced of M. angustata, were not well resolved.\n\nDescription\nMyosotis angustata plants are rosettes. The rosette leaves have broad petioles that difficult to distinguish from the leaf blades. The rosette leaves are about 20 mm long by 4 mm wide (length: width ratio 5: 1), usually linear-spathulate and widest at or above the middle, with an subacute apex. Both surfaces of the leaf are uniformly and densely covered in appressed hairs, with lower density on the lower surface. Each rosette has several ascending to erect, ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 150 mm long. The cauline leaves are similar to the rosette leaves, but become smaller, are linear or narrow-oblong and subacute, and have hairs similar to the rosette leaves. The flowers are many per inflorescence, and each is borne on a short pedicel, each with a bract. The calyx is 5–8 mm long at flowering and fruiting, lobed to one-half of its length, and densely covered in straight hairs, as well as some hooked hairs, all of which are antrorse. The corolla is white and about 7 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, and small scales alternating with the petals. The anthers are exserted with the anthers surpassing the faucal scales.

21,Question: Where is Mount Brown located and what is its elevation?,"['Mount Brown is a 6,958-foot-elevation (2,121-meter) mountain summit located in Liberty County, Montana, United States.\n\nDescription\nMount Brown is the highest point in the county, highest point of the East Butte complex, and second-highest peak in the Sweet Grass Hills. It is situated 26 miles (42 km) north of Chester, Montana, and eight miles (13 km) south of the Canada–United States border. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north to the Milk River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,000 feet (910 meters) above the surrounding plains in four miles (6.4 km) which makes it a prominent landmark visible for many miles. The slopes provide habitat for elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer.\n\nGeology\nMount Brown is an exposed laccolith composed of syenitic  and monzonitic trachytes created by an igneous intrusion through older Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks during the Eocene, about 50 million years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily shale and siltstone. Over time, erosion of the sedimentary rock has exposed the solidified laccolith which is more resistant to weathering.\n\nHistory\nThe Sweet Grass Hills, which are centered in buffalo hunting territory, are sacred to the Blackfoot and other tribes.

23,"Question: When was the Roanoke and Tar River Railroad fully merged into the Seaboard Air Line Railway network, and what happened to the line after that?","[""The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was a railroad running from Boykins, Virginia south to Lewiston, North Carolina, a distance of 36 miles.\nThe Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was chartered by the North Carolina State Legislature in 1871 though no action to construct the line happened until 1885, when the charter was reissued.  It would operate as a subsidiary of the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, which it connected with at the north end in Boykins.  Construction began in 1887 and was complete a year later.In 1892, the Murfreesboro Railroad was built, which branched off the Roanoke and Tar River Railroad at Pendleton and ran to Murfreesboro, North Carolina.  The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad would acquire the Murfreesboro Railroad in 1893 and operated it as a branch line until 1897.  When they discontinued service on the branch, the town of Murfreesboro took action to prevent the abandonment.  But in the late evening of May 7, 1897, the company removed the branch's tracks in the dark of the night.By the end of the 1800s, the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway network.  The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was fully merged into the Seaboard Air Line in 1911.  The line would operate as the Seaboard Air Line's Lewiston Subdivision.In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line merged with its rival, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL).  The merged company was named the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL).  The Lewiston Subdivision connected with an ex-ACL line in Kelford.  In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation.  The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation.\nThe southernmost five miles of the line from Kelford to Lewiston was abandoned sometime after 1986.  The remaining line from Boykins to Kelford was sold to the North Carolina and Virginia Railroad in 1987, who operates the line today.\n\nHistoric stations\n\n\n== References ==""]",,0.5,0.23529411764705882,0.7054115094365572

25,"Question: What is the purpose of the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act, and how does it aim to expand access to methadone for patients with opioid use disorder?","['The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act is a proposed United States congressional bill introduced in the 118th United States Congress. Introduced in response to the national opioid epidemic, the legislation would expand access to methadone, an approved medication for treating opioid use disorder (OUD).The bill would give pharmacies the ability to provide methadone to patients with OUD, which can currently only be accessed at methadone clinics. Additionally, the bill would allow approved healthcare providers to prescribe take-home doses for OUD patients.\n\nBackground\nFederal law prohibit physicians from directly prescribing methadone for patients with opioid use disorder, and prevent pharmacies from dispensing the medication.\nClassified as a schedule II substance, OUD patients are only permitted to access the medication at opioid treatment facilities (OTPs), known as methadone clinics. Patients are generally required to visit clinics in-person to receive daily doses of methadone, and are usually prevented from receiving ""take-home"" doses.  \nCritics of these regulations note that while pharmacies are prohibited from dispensing methadone, they are permitted to dispense the same medication for pain. However, opponents of relaxing regulations on methadone treatment for OUD argue that expanding access could lead to misuse of methadone.Rules were enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase OUD patients\' ability to receive take-home doses of methadone. In 2022, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) proposed to make expanded access permanent.\n\nLegislative history\nOn March 2, 2023, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Senate version of the legislation, known as S.644. Accompanying House legislation, known as H.R.1359, was introduced by Representatives Don Bacon (R-NE) and Donald Norcross (D-NJ). Representative David Trone, a Democrat from Maryland, has endorsed the legislation, arguing that current laws hinder patients\' ability to receive medication.\n\n\n== References ==']",,1.0,0.75,0.6856332610512449

It is located in Dunkeld Cathedral, Perthshire, Scotland, and was built for Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan (1343 – c. 1394), who is buried underneath.The effigy is placed on top of the altar tomb, and shows Stuart in full and highly detailed knightly armour, with a lion (or dog) resting at his feet. It is in poor condition having been broken apart and defaced in the 16th century during the Scottish Reformation. The effigy is placed on top of an altar tomb lined with 22 pleurants (or ""weepers""), who are also dressed in armour.\n\nAlexander Stewart, the Wolf of Badenoch\nStuart was the third surviving son  son of king Robert II of Scotland (1316 – 1390). He is known to history as the deeply unpopular ""Wolf of Badenoch"", a name given due to  his notorious cruelty, in particular for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its 13th-century cathedral in May 1370, for which he earned a reputation as ""an enemy of the Church"", and was described in 2017 as ""Scothland\'s vilest man"".\n\nDescription\nThe tomb is inscribed with the year 1420.The monument remains in its origional position behind the choir screen at the east-end of the cathedral, while Stuart\'s grave is underneath.\n\nEffigy\nThe effigy is made from grey–green marble and measures 7 ft (2.1 m) in length. Stewart lies on a cloak and is dressed in full armour with his sword by his left slide. His head is protected by a bascinet (an open-faced combat helmet) and visor and he wears a pauldron—a type of spaulder covering the shoulders.

He has a hip-belt of a type worn in Scotland until the end of the 15th century.The animal resting at his feet may be a lion, or—less likely—a dog.\nThe effigy is in poor condition, having been damaged c. 1560 during the Scottish Reformation.

31,"Question: How long did the Siege of Mariupol last, and what was the outcome?","['The Siege of Mariupol began on 24 February 2022 and lasted until 20 May, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It saw fighting between the Russian Armed Forces (alongside the Donetsk People\'s Republic People\'s Militia) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control over Mariupol. Lasting for almost three months, the siege ended in a victory for Russia and the Donetsk People\'s Republic, as Ukraine lost control of the city amidst Russia\'s eastern Ukraine offensive and southern Ukraine offensive; all Ukrainian troops remaining in the city surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works on 20 May 2022, after they were ordered to cease fighting.Mariupol is located in Ukraine\'s Donetsk Oblast, and following the siege, it was initially controlled by the Donetsk People\'s Republic, supported by occupying Russian troops. However, it was later subjected to Russia\'s unilateral annexation of southeastern Ukraine, and remains under direct Russian control as of 10 May 2023.\nDuring the Russian siege, the Red Cross described the situation in Mariupol as ""apocalyptic"" while Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of engineering a major humanitarian crisis in the city. Ukrainian officials reported that approximately 25,000 civilians had been killed and that at least 95% of the city had been destroyed during the fighting, primarily by large-scale Russian bombardments. In an official statement, the United Nations confirmed the deaths of 1,348 civilians in Mariupol, but warned that the true death toll was likely thousands higher while also reporting that 90% of the city\'s residential buildings had been damaged or completely destroyed.Major combat operations in the city effectively ended on 16 May 2022 after Ukraine\'s Azov Regiment surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works. Some Western reports described the siege as a pyrrhic or symbolic Russian victory, with others noting that the humanitarian impact of the takeover was a ""reputational disaster"" for Russia. However, the loss of the city has also been seen as a significant defeat for Ukraine.\n\nBackground\nMariupol was considered a major strategic city and therefore was a target for Russian forces. It was the largest city in the Ukrainian-controlled portion of Donetsk Oblast, and was also one of the largest Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Mariupol was a major industrial hub, home of the Illich and Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, and the largest city on the Sea of Azov.Control of its port on the western shore of the Sea of Azov is vital to the economy of Ukraine. For Russia, it would allow a land route to Crimea and allow passage by Russian marine traffic. Capturing the city gave Russia full control over the Sea of Azov.In 2014 after the Revolution of Dignity, Mariupol was swept by pro-Russian protests against the new government. Tensions erupted into the war in Donbas in early May, and during the unrest, militiamen of the separatist and Russian-backed Donetsk People\'s Republic (DPR) took control of the city and forced Ukrainian troops to abandon it during the first battle for Mariupol. However, the following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the city in an offensive. In August, the DPR and Russian troops captured the village of Novoazovsk, 45 km east of Mariupol near the Russo-Ukrainian border. With the town captured and forces renewed, in September the DPR attempted to capture the city again in the second battle for Mariupol. Fighting reached the eastern outskirts, but the separatists were eventually repelled. In October, then-DPR Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko vowed to retake the city. Mariupol was then indiscriminately bombed by rockets in January 2015. Fearing a future third offensive into Mariupol, in February Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack into Shyrokyne, a village located 11 km east of Mariupol with the objective of expelling the separatist forces from the city limits and creating a buffer zone. The separatists withdrew from Shyrokyne four months later. The conflict was frozen when the Minsk II ceasefire agreement was signed in 2015.2018 saw again tension in the region around Mariupol, as the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to transit from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol. The Kerch Strait incident raised tensions, and martial law was briefly declared by Ukraine in fears that a war would break out between the two countries.One of the most instrumental groups for the recapture and subsequent defenses of Mariupol was the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian volunteer militia, controversial for its openly neo-Nazi and ultranationalist members. By November 2014 Azov was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine, with Mariupol as its headquarters. As one of Vladimir Putin\'s stated goals for the invasion was the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, Mariupol represented an important ideological and symbolical target for the Russian forces.Prior to the siege, around 100,000 residents left Mariupol, according to the city\'s deputy mayor.Prior to falling to Russian forces, the city was defended by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, the Ukrainian Naval Infantry, the National Guard of Ukraine (primarily the Azov Regiment), the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine, and irregular forces.\n\nAdvances to Mariupol\nPreliminary shelling and advance on the city\nOn 24 February, the day the invasion began, Russian artillery bombarded the city, reportedly injuring 26 people.On the morning of 25 February, Russian forces advanced from DPR territory in the east towards Mariupol. They encountered Ukrainian forces near the village of Pavlopil, whom repelled the Russian advance. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, said 22 Russian tanks had been destroyed in the skirmish. That evening, the Russian Navy, drawing on the capabilities provided by the Black Sea Fleet, reportedly began an amphibious assault on the Sea of Azov coastline 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defense official stated that the Russians may have deployed thousands of marines from this beachhead.On 26 February, Russian forces continued to bombard Mariupol with artillery. Later, the government of Greece announced that ten ethnic Greek civilians had been killed by Russian strikes at Mariupol, six in the village of Sartana and four in the village of Buhas.On the morning of 27 February, mayor Boychenko said that a Russian tank column had advanced on Mariupol from the DPR, but this attack was repulsed by Ukrainian forces, with six Russian soldiers captured. Later that day, a 6-year-old girl in Mariupol was killed by Russian shelling. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of Donetsk Oblast, stated that fighting in Mariupol had continued throughout the night of 27 February.Throughout 28 February, the city remained under Ukrainian control despite being surrounded by Russian troops and constantly shelled. Electricity, gas, and internet connection to most of the city was cut during the evening. Later, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Russian Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was killed by a Ukrainian sniper near Mariupol, but other sources said that he had been killed during the Kyiv offensive.\n\nMariupol surrounded\nOn 1 March, Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the nearby city of Volnovakha and that they would soon do the same to Mariupol. Russian artillery later bombarded Mariupol, causing over 21 injuries.The city was fully surrounded on 2 March, after which the siege intensified. Russian shelling killed a teenager and wounded two other teenagers who were playing soccer outside. Boychenko announced the city was suffering from a water outage and had experienced massive casualties. He also said Russian forces were preventing civilians from exiting.\nLater on 2 March, Russian artillery targeted a densely populated neighborhood of Mariupol, shelling it']",,0.0,0.14893617021276595,0.720456445871071
32,"Question: Which countries and international organizations have imposed sanctions against Russia and Crimea, and what were the reasons for these sanctions?","['International sanctions have been imposed against Russia and Crimea during the Russo-Ukrainian War by a large number of countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union, and international organisations following the Russian annexation of Crimea, which began in late February 2014. Belarus has also been sanctioned for its cooperation with and assistance to Russian armed forces. The sanctions were imposed against individuals, businesses, and officials from Russia and Ukraine. Russia responded with sanctions against several countries, including a total ban on food imports from Australia, Canada, Norway, Japan, the United States, the EU and the United Kingdom.The sanctions contributed to the collapse of the Russian ruble and worsened the economic impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. They also caused economic damage to the EU economy, with total losses estimated at €100 billion (as of 2015). As of 2014, Russia\'s finance minister announced that the sanctions had cost Russia $40 billion, with another $100 billion loss in 2014 due to decrease in the price of oil the same year. Following sanctions imposed in August 2018, economic losses incurred by Russia amounted to around 0.5–1.5% in foregone GDP growth.Russian president Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of conspiring with Saudi Arabia to intentionally weaken the Russian economy by decreasing the price of oil. By mid-2016, Russia had lost an estimated $170 billion due to financial sanctions, with another $400 billion lost in revenues from oil and gas. According to Ukrainian officials, the sanctions forced Russia to change its approach toward Ukraine and undermined the Russian military advances in the region. Representatives of these countries say that they will lift sanctions against Russia only after Moscow fulfills the Minsk II agreements.As of June 2023, sanctions by the European Union and United States continue to be in effect. In January 2022, the EU announced the latest extension of sanctions until 31 July 2022. Following Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, the EU, and other countries introduced or significantly expanded sanctions to include Vladimir Putin and other government officials. They also cut off selected Russian banks from SWIFT. The 2022 boycott of Russia and Belarus triggered the 2022 Russian financial crisis.\n\nBackground\nBefore the eruption of the Crimean crisis and the War in Donbass, tensions already existed between Russia and the United States over human rights issues. In December 2012, the US enacted the Magnitsky Act, intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009 by prohibiting their entry to the US and use of its banking system. 18 individuals were originally affected by the Act. In December 2016, Congress enacted the Global Magnitsky Act to allow the US Government to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world. On 21 December 2017, 13 additional names were added to the list of sanctioned individuals, not just Russians. Other countries passed similar laws to ban foreigners deemed guilty of human rights abuses from entering their countries.\nIn response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, some governments and international organisations, led by the United States and European Union, imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses. As the unrest expanded into other parts of Eastern Ukraine, and later escalated into the ongoing war in the Donbass region, the scope of the sanctions increased.Overall, three types of sanctions were imposed: ban on provision of technology for oil and gas exploration, ban on provision of credits to Russian oil companies and state banks, travel restrictions on the influential Russian citizens close to President Putin and involved in the annexation of Crimea. The Russian government responded in kind, with sanctions against some Canadian and American individuals and, in August 2014, with a total ban on food imports from the European Union, United States, Norway, Canada and Australia.\n\nSanctions against Russian and Ukrainian individuals, companies and officials\nFirst round: March/April 2014\nOn 6 March 2014, U.S. president Barack Obama, invoking, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and ordering sanctions, including travel bans and the freezing of U.S. assets, against not-yet-specified individuals who had ""asserted governmental authority in the Crimean region without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine"" and whose actions were found, inter alia, to ""undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine"".On 17 March 2014, the United States, the European Union, and Canada introduced specifically targeted sanctions, the day after the disputed Crimean referendum and a few hours before Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing Crimea as an independent state, laying the groundwork for its annexation of Crimea by Russia. The principal EU sanction aimed to ""prevent the entry into ... their territories of the natural persons responsible for actions which undermine ... the territorial integrity ... of Ukraine, and of natural persons associated with them, as listed in the Annex"". The EU imposed its sanctions ""in the absence of de-escalatory steps by the Russian Federation"" in order to bring an end to the violence in eastern Ukraine. The EU at the same time clarified that the union ""remains ready to reverse its decisions and reengage with Russia when it starts contributing actively and without ambiguities to finding a solution to the Ukrainian crisis"".These 17 March sanctions were the most wide-ranging sanctions used against Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Japan also announced sanctions against Russia, which included the suspension of talks regarding military matters, space, investment, and visa requirements. A few days later, the US government expanded the sanctions.On 19 March, Australia imposed sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea. These sanctions targeted financial dealings and travel bans on those who have been instrumental in the Russian threat to Ukraine\'s sovereignty. Australian sanctions were expanded on 21 May.In early April, Albania, Iceland and Montenegro, as well as Ukraine, imposed the same restrictions and travel bans as those of the EU on 17 March. Igor Lukšić, foreign minister of Montenegro, said that despite a ""centuries old-tradition"" of good ties with Russia, joining the EU in imposing sanctions had ""always been the only reasonable choice"". Slightly earlier in March, Moldova imposed the same sanctions against former president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and a number of former Ukrainian officials, as announced by the EU on 5 March.In response to the sanctions introduced by the United States and the European Union, the State Duma (Lower House of the Russian parliament) unanimously passed a resolution asking for all members of the Duma be included on the sanctions list. The sanctions were expanded to include prominent Russian businessmen and women a few days later.\n\nSecond round: April 2014\nOn 10 April, the Council of Europe suspended the voting rights of Russia\'s delegation.On 28 April, the United States imposed a ban on business transactions within its territory on seven Russian officials, including Igor Sechin, executive chairman of the Russian state oil company Rosneft, and 17 Russian companies.On the same day, the EU issued travel bans against a further 15 individuals.

33,Question: What factors contributed to the Sri Lankan economic crisis?,"['The Sri Lankan economic crisis is an ongoing crisis in the island country of Sri Lanka that started in 2019. It is the country\'s worst economic crisis since its independence in 1948. It has led to unprecedented levels of inflation, near-depletion of foreign exchange reserves, shortages of medical supplies, and an increase in prices of basic commodities. The crisis is said to have begun due to multiple compounding factors like tax cuts, money creation, a nationwide policy to shift to organic or biological farming, the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. The subsequent economic hardships resulted in the 2022 Sri Lankan protests.\nSri Lanka had been earmarked for sovereign default, as the remaining foreign exchange reserves of US$1.9 billion as of March 2022 would not be sufficient to pay the country\'s foreign debt obligations for 2022, with $4 billion to be repaid. An International Sovereign Bond repayment of $1 billion was due to be paid by the government in July 2022. Bloomberg reported that Sri Lanka had a total of $8.6 billion in repayments due in 2022, including both local debt and foreign debt. In April 2022, the Sri Lankan government announced that it was defaulting, making it the first sovereign default in Sri Lankan history since its independence in 1948 and the first state in the Asia-Pacific region to enter sovereign default in the 21st century.In June 2022, then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in parliament that the economy had collapsed, leaving it unable to pay for essentials.In September 2022, a United Nations report said that the economic crisis is a result of officials\' impunity for human rights abuses and economic crimes. According to the Sri Lankan finance ministry, the country\'s foreign reserves had grown by 23.5% from US$1.7 billion in September 2022 to US$2.1 billion in February 2023, representing a US$400 million increase. Sri Lanka teeters on the edge of financial insolvency and has halted repayments on its international debts.\n\nBackground\nAccording to W. A. Wijewardena, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the country was a long way into an economic crisis in 2015. The government that came into power in 2015 knew this and had been warned by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka about a number of risks. While the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 had presented a strong economic policy to address the situation, the coalition government could not get the policy pushed through Parliament, which would eventually result in further policy confusion in the coming months.The government did not adequately address the economic warnings and emerging dangers, consuming itself in other government related activities such as ""constitutional reforms"". Certain practices, including those used by the Ministry of Finance led by Ravi Karunanayake, were globally frowned upon. Election related economic decisions were pushed such as excessive distribution of freebies. The Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka\'s 2014 State of the Economy Report highlighted hot money, worrying borrowing practices, temporary and superficial quick-fixes and monopoly of foreign direct investment flow into the hospitality sector.Further political turmoil in 2018 worsened the economic outlook. By that time the government had carried out several reforms under an IMF supported program towards fiscal monetary consolidation and had successfully controlled inflation. These reforms included an automatic fuel pricing formula which significantly reduced fiscal risks posed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), raised the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 11 percent to 15 percent, and broadened the VAT base by removing exemptions. Many of the reforms were reversed by the new government after the 2019 elections.Under Maithripala Sirisena administration, the 2019 Central Bank Bill was drafted to make the Central Bank independent from political influence by banning the Treasury Secretary and any member of the Government from becoming members of the Monetary Board. Money printing was also to be banned under this bill, as it states: ""The Central Bank shall not purchase securities issued by the government, by any government-owned entity, or any other public entity in the primary market."" Then Central Bank Governor, Indrajit Coomaraswamy, noted Balance of Payments issues, increased inflation, and asset bubbles as reasons for the ban. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Party opposed an independent Central Bank and discarded the bill as soon as they came to power.Many experts compared Lebanon\'s economic situation with that of Sri Lanka and had warned that Sri Lanka too was on the way to defaulting on its sovereign bonds. Both nations had similar issues, including deep economic crises occurring after their successive governments piled up unsustainable debts following the end of civil wars. To reduce the inflation and control the economy crisis in April 2022, Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe was appointed as the 17th Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to replace Ajith Nivard Cabraal.\n\nCauses\nTax cuts and money creation\nThe Government of Sri Lanka under president Gotabaya Rajapaksa made large tax cuts that affected government revenue and fiscal policies, causing budget deficits to soar.  These cuts included increased tax-free thresholds that resulted in a 33.5% decline in registered taxpayers, reducing VAT to 8%, reducing corporate tax from  28% to 24%, the abolishment of the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax and the 2% “nation-building tax” which financed infrastructure development. The massive loss of tax revenue resulted in rating agencies downgrading the sovereign credit rating making it harder to take more debt. In 2021 P. B. Jayasundera stated that President Rajapaksa was aware of the loss of revenue but considered it an ""investment"" and had no plans of increasing taxes for another 5 years.To cover government spending, the Central Bank began printing money in record amounts ignoring advice from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stop printing money and instead hike interest rates and raise taxes while cutting spending.  The IMF warned that continuing to print money would lead to an economic implosion. The tax cuts were also opposed by the former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera who noted that as the Sri Lankan government already had far less tax revenue relative to most countries which combined with its high debt load tax cuts would be dangerous. Samaraweera predicted that “If these proposals are implemented like this not only will the entire country go bankrupt, but the entire country will become another Venezuela or another Greece.”On 6 April 2022, the CBSL allegedly printed 119.08 billion rupees, making it the highest reported amount printed on a single day by the CBSL for the year 2022. The total money added to financial markets for the year 2022 increased to Rs. 432.76 billion.\n\nExternal debt\nUntil mid-2000s, the Sri Lankan debt was mainly from multilateral lending agencies, after which it was reoriented under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa to foreign investors and lenders. Sri Lanka issues its first international sovereign bond in 2007, with high interest rates to incentivise investors. According to commentators, the money was used to fund vanity projects rather than projects of national utility.Sri Lanka\'s foreign debt increased substantially, going from US$11.3 billion in 2005 to $56.3 billion in 2020. While foreign debt was about 42% of the GDP in 2019, it rose to 119% of its GDP in 2021. By February 2022, the country had only $2.31 billion left in its reserves, yet faces debt repayments of around $4 billion in 2022, which also includes a $1 billion international sovereign bond (ISB) maturing in July.In 2020, US economist Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, published a report that blamed the quantitative easing policy made by US banks after 2008, for exporting debt bubbles to deve']",,0.0,0.11904761904761904,0.7307013840895507
34,"Question: How many people were killed and injured in the 2022 Hormozgan earthquakes, and what was the maximum intensity of the earthquakes?","['The 2022 Hormozgan earthquakes were a pair of doublet earthquakes that struck southern Iran on 1 July, 2022. The earthquakes, which occurred around two hours apart, killed seven people and injured dozens more.\n\nTectonic setting\nHormozgan province lies at the southern margin of the collision zone between the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate. This collision lead to the creation of the Zagros Mountains and the Iranian Plateau. The main fault system that runs through the Zagros Range is the Zagros fold and thrust belt, which has been responsible for causing many earthquakes in Iran over the years.\n\nEarthquake\nThis earthquake is part of a sequence of earthquakes on 1 July, 2022, in southern Iran that began with a magnitude 6.0, followed by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock two hours later, and a magnitude 6.0 earthquake one minute after the magnitude 5.7 earthquake. The first two events were initially reported as 6.1 magnitude, while the third was an initial 6.2. They were revised down several hours later. Earthquake sequences similar to this one have previously occurred in the Zagros Mountains, with a similar sequence occurring in November 2021.\n\nAftershocks\nBy 3 July, there were twelve aftershocks, the strongest of which was 5.7 Mw. On July 23, two more aftershocks occurred, measuring 5.4 and 5.6 Mw\u202f. The two quakes caused further damage to houses, and caused one indirect injury.\n\nIntensity\nThe earthquakes had a maximum intensity of VII (Very strong). The strongest shaking was reported in the provinces of Hormozgan and Fars. The earthquake was felt throughout the Middle East in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, as well as parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were severely affected by a more deadly earthquake 10 days earlier.\n\nOther events\nTwo offshore earthquakes occurred in the same province near the town of Kish a month before the July events. The earthquakes measured 5.5 and 5.6 on the moment magnitude scale, and occurred at a depth of 10.0 km. The first earthquake injured four and damaged 20 buildings. The latter caused one death and 37 injuries.Another earthquake, measuring magnitude 5.9 struck the same area on March 16 of that same year. It caused two injuries and minor damage in several villages.\n\nImpact\nTwelve towns and over 300 villages, with a combined population of around 900,000, were impacted by the earthquakes. The village of Sayeh Khvosh, home to around 1,100 people, was completely destroyed. The governor of Hormozgan, Mahdi Dousti, said that it would take several months to rebuild the village. In Bandar Khamir, at least 45 houses were affected, and 35 others were damaged in the town of Kong. In total, at least 392 houses were damaged or destroyed. There were also reports of power outages. A road between Bandar Khamir and Bandar Lengeh was blocked by a landslide. Seven people were killed and 111 others were injured. At least 22 of the injuries were serious enough to require hospitalisation.\n\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in 2022\nList of earthquakes in Iran\n\n\n== References ==']",,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.7178324716306251
35,"Question: How many people were killed and injured in the mass shooting during the Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois?","['On July 4, 2022, a mass shooting occurred during an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, United States. The shooting occurred at 10:14 a.m. CDT (UTC−05:00), roughly 15 minutes after the parade had started. Seven people were killed, and 48 others were wounded by bullets or shrapnel.\nAuthorities apprehended 21 year old Robert Eugene Crimo III more than eight hours after the shooting and charged him the next day with seven counts of first-degree murder. On July 27, the charges were upgraded to 21 counts of first-degree murder, 48 counts of attempted murder, and 48 counts of aggravated battery.\nThe incident is one of the two deadliest mass shootings in Illinois history, the other being the 1993 Brown\'s Chicken massacre, which also resulted in the deaths of seven people.\n\nBackground\nHighland Park is an affluent suburban community of about 30,000, located in Lake County, Illinois, United States, 25 miles (40 km) north of Chicago, in the area\'s North Shore. The city held a Fourth of July celebration, which included a parade that began at 10:00 a.m. CDT (UTC−05:00). The parade started at the intersection of Laurel and St. Johns Avenues, headed north on St. Johns Avenue, then turned west on Central Avenue, and continued to Sunset Woods Park.According to the Los Angeles Times, ""A 2020 study by Brandeis University and the University of Chicago found Highland Park had among the Chicago region\'s highest concentrations of Jewish residents."" The neighboring suburb of Highwood is home to a large Hispanic population.\n\nEvents\nShooting\nThe shooting began at 10:14 a.m. in downtown Highland Park, with the shooter firing a rifle from the rooftop of the Ross Cosmetics building, a local store on the northwest corner of Central Avenue and 2nd Street. The gunman had gained access to the elevated position by using an unsecured ladder attached to the building.The shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15 semiautomatic rifle with three 30-round magazines. A total of 83 shots were fired. Victims included spectators and some of those marching in the parade. At least one parade attendee provided medical treatment to those injured, before first responders arrived. Footage shot by Chicago Sun-Times reporter Lynn Sweet, a spectator at the parade, shows a participating klezmer band on a float continuing to play as gunfire began, and many attendees running while screaming. Additional photos of the scene were captured by attendees and posted to social media.\n\nManhunt and suspect\'s capture\nOver 100 law enforcement officers from multiple agencies responded to the shooting. The shooter ceased firing as law enforcement officers approached the building, causing the shooter to flee the scene and evade immediate capture. During his escape, the rifle Crimo used fell from his bag and was recovered by police within minutes. He then drove to the Madison, Wisconsin area, with a Kel-Tec SUB-2000 semiautomatic rifle in his car. He considered attacking another Independence Day celebration in Madison, but decided against it. He discarded his cell phone in Middleton, Wisconsin. It was later suspected that after fleeing the scene Crimo borrowed his mother\'s car and drove to Madison, Wisconsin where he briefly contemplated a second attack.A driver from Waukegan and his passengers spotted Crimo\'s damaged 2010 Honda Fit on the southbound U.S Route 41 near Wadsworth. Over the next 13 minutes, they relayed information to 911 operators. Crimo was stopped by North Chicago Police and Lake County Sheriff units at the intersection of U.S Route 41 and Westleigh Road in Lake Forest, Illinois, and apprehended at approximately 6:30 p.m., more than eight hours after the shooting began.\n\nVictims\nSeven people were killed, and 48 others were injured by either bullets or shrapnel during the attack. Five of the victims—all adults—died at the scene, and two died at the hospital.Mexican authorities have said two men killed at the parade were ""natives of the country."" One of these was a 78-year-old Mexican grandfather who was visiting family in the area, and another was a 69-year-old man. Two Jewish victims that were killed were a 63-year-old woman and an 88-year-old grandfather. Another was a 64-year-old mother of two. Of the others that were killed, two victims were a married couple in their 30s who attended the parade with their 2-year-old son, who survived, and was found wandering unaccompanied.The shooting victims ranged in age from 8 to 88 years old. Highland Park Hospital reported that they were treating 26 people after the shooting, 25 being gunshot wounds, with five later transferred to Evanston Hospital. Additionally, four of the injured were transported to Glenbrook Hospital, and several others were taken to hospitals outside of the Northshore University Medical System network.\n\nInvestigation\nHighland Park authorities collaborated with the FBI, Illinois State Police, and Chicago Police during the investigation and manhunt. The police believe only one shooter was involved and the shooting was described as appearing to be ""very random (and) very intentional"". After his arrest, Crimo\'s home in Highwood, a small suburb just north of Highland Park, was raided by FBI agents.Lake County authorities alleged that Crimo planned the attack for weeks, and that he dressed in women\'s clothing and hid his facial tattoos in order to flee the scene after the attack, among panicked parade-goers. Mayor of Highland Park Nancy Rotering said that she believed that the weapon used in the crime was obtained legally. Police seized three rifles, one shotgun, and one handgun from Crimo.Crimo\'s motives remain unclear. The London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue said it appeared Crimo’s extensive online presence contained posts that gravitated toward far-right and neo-fascist ideologies. A Highland Park rabbi stated that, three months before the shooting, Crimo had entered Central Avenue Synagogue, a Chabad house, during the Passover Seder and was asked to leave. The Chabad House is located two blocks from where the July 4 shooting occurred. However, investigators have determined no racial or religious motivation for the shooting. Michael Masters, national director and CEO of the Secure Community Network headquartered in Chicago, said, ""Nothing overtly we have identified in his social media posts says this was an antisemitic attack, but we are coordinating with law enforcement. Apparently on social media, there are some indications he was ideating around the Fourth of July for some period of time, which would indicate this was not an attack on one particular community.""According to experts on QAnon and conspiracy theory movements, Crimo\'s social media diet, while extreme, was distinct from the realm of QAnon. Mike Rothschild, an author who has written on QAnon, said, ""[T]he world Crimo lived in was pretty far off Q. He was in a 4chan bubble of ironic Nazi and anime memes, fascist-inspired music, and mass shooter ideation that basically consumes nothing but irony and sadness.""\n\nLegal proceedings\nRobert Eugene Crimo III (born September 20, 2000) was charged on July 5 with seven counts of first-degree murder. The next day, he confessed to the shooting. Lake County Sheriff\'s Office said that he is being held without bail. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 28, 2022, but the hearing was obviated when a Lake County, Illinois grand jury indicted Crimo on July 27, 2022. Crimo was indicted on 117 felony counts: for each of the 7 deceased victims, three counts of first-degree murder (21 counts), and for each of the 48 victims struck by a bullet or shrapnel, one count of attempted murder (48 counts) and one count of aggravated battery (48 additional counts).\n\nAccused\nCrimo attended Highland Park High School, but dropped out before his junior year. He has performed under the stage name ""Awake the Rapper"", and posted his albums on Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music; which included apparent references to the QAnon conspiracy theory.

36,Question: What are some of the controversies surrounding Uber?,"['Uber Technologies, Inc.  or Uber has been the subject of a number of controversies. These include both unethical business practices such as flouting local regulations and sabotaging competitors. It has also received criticism for its treatment of employees, facing claims of racial discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Concerns have also been raised about Uber\'s retention of customer data, particularly in the wake of their handling of data leaks. These issues have led to the company being banned from operating in some countries.\n\nIgnoring and evading local regulations\nUber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is ""a technology company"" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber\'s strategy was generally to ""seek forgiveness rather than permission"". In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber\'s response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy.  Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber\'s policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law. Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial.In March 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called ""Greyball"" to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose. The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber\'s private hire operator licence in September 2017.  A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a ""panic button"" system, codenamed ""Ripley"", that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids. Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.\n\nAttempts to sabotage competitors\nIn 2014, Uber employees were caught ordering and then quickly cancelling rides on competing services Lyft and Gett, in an attempt to disrupt these services. In 2014, Uber was also accused of recruiting people to use competing services for the sole purpose of recruiting their drivers to Uber, at which point the recruiter would receive a commission. Uber denied that it had any involvement with the cancellation of orders or the recruitment efforts.\n\nWage disputes\nIn January 2017, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of having misled drivers about potential earnings.In 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of thousands of Uber drivers, alleging that Uber’s “upfront prices” policy did not provide drivers with the 80% of fares to which they were entitled. The lawsuit was settled for $345,622, with each driver in the class getting at least $20.In May 2017, after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in New York, Uber admitted to underpaying New York City drivers tens of millions of dollars over 2.5 years by calculating driver commissions on a net amount. Uber agreed to pay the amounts owed plus interest.\n\nBoycott in the US\nIn late January 2017, GrabYourWallet advised to boycott Uber because the company did not join its Protests against Executive Order 13769, while Travis Kalanick, then CEO of Uber, was a member of Donald Trump\'s ""business advisory council"" and GrabYourWallet was advising boycotts of businesses with ties to Trump. Approximately 200,000 users deleted the Uber mobile app. On February 2, 2017, Kalanick resigned from the council, which disbanded in August 2017.\n\nSexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017)\nOn February 19, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident. Kalanick was alleged to have been aware of the complaint. On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber\'s Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search. After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber\'s board of directors, in June 2017, Uber fired over 20 employees. Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to ""dig up dirt"" on the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each. In December 2019, Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares.\n\nGod view and privacy concerns\nIn November 2014, then U.S. Senator Al Franken, Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, expressed concerns regarding ride sharing privacy, specifically Uber\'s ""God View"", whereby the whereabouts of specific customers, including journalists and politicians, are able to be tracked by Uber insiders. In December 2014, in response to Franken, Uber implemented restrictions on that function.In 2012, an Uber employee tracked the frequency of probable one-night stands in six U.S. cities by day and neighborhood, by correlating late-night and next-day trips. The blog posting coined the term ""ride of glory"" for the Uber equivalent of a walk of shame.\n\nDelayed disclosure of data breaches\nOn February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior. Names and license plate information from approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014, but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals.An announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers\' license information. Hackers used employees\' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a ""creden']",,0.0,0.17647058823529413,0.7171632307607082
37,Question: What was the estimated timeline for fully restoring power in Moore County after the shooting attack on the electrical distribution substations?,"['On December 3, 2022, a shooting attack was carried out on two electrical distribution substations located in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. Damage from the attack left up to 40,000 residential and business customers without electrical power. Initial estimates were that up to four days could be required to fully restore power in the area. A state of emergency and corresponding curfew were enacted by local government officials in the wake of the incident.\n\nBackground\nLess than two weeks prior to the Moore County substation incident, the FBI had sent a report to private industry in which they stated that there had been an increase in reported threats to electric infrastructure from people who espouse “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideology"", with an aim of creating civil disorder and inspiring further violence. The Department of Homeland Security cited\na 14-page document released in a Telegram channel favored by accelerationist groups seeking to speed the overthrow of the US government featured a white supremacist instruction guide to low-tech attacks meant to bring chaos, including how to attack a power grid with guns.\nWhile it is unclear whether such threats are directly associated with this attack, government officials have previously expressed concern over the possibility of violent extremists attacking the electrical grid. Prior to the Moore County attack, other attacks on the electrical grid had occurred in Metcalf, California in 2013, in Arkansas in 2013, in Utah in 2016, and in Washington and Oregon (dates undisclosed).\n\nAttack\nAccording to Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields, a Duke Energy power substation was severely damaged by gunfire in Carthage at around 7 p.m. Gunfire was later directed at a second substation in West End, ultimately resulting in a loss of electrical power to the majority of the county. A journalist from a local newspaper reported that one of the substations\' gates had been damaged and was lying in an access road, with the pole holding the gate having been snapped off at the ground.Outages began starting just after 7 p.m. on December 4 in Moore County and spread to central and southern parts of the county, with roughly 36,000 customers reported to be without power. Duke Energy officials indicated that significant, serious damage had occurred to equipment located at the substations and that repairs could take several days.\n\nInvestigation\nIn addition to the Moore County Sheriff\'s Department, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and police departments from all eleven municipalities in Moore County are participating in the investigation. The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) of the Department of Energy is also reported to be assisting.Investigators revealed that they had recovered about two dozen shell-casings, described as being from a ""high powered rifle"", from the attack sites. These casings were expected to be used to query the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network for possible matches with casings fired from the same weapon at other crime scenes. The casings, some of the only physical evidence available, were also being looked at as a starting point which could lead to other evidence such as tire tracks or shoe prints.On December 7, 2022, Governor Roy Cooper announced that a reward of up to $75,000 was being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. The money consists of three separate $25,000 rewards, offered by the State of North Carolina, Duke Energy, and Moore County.\n\nMotive\nOfficials have described the attack as ""targeted"" and ""intentional, willful and malicious"" but did not immediately provide any information on suspects or a motive for the attack.After the incident, numerous posts on the internet have speculated that the attack was an attempt to disrupt a local drag show that was taking place in the nearby town of Southern Pines that evening; however, these claims are unconfirmed and disputed.By December 7, investigators were focusing on two possible motives for the attack. One scenario relates to known online writings by domestic extremists, which encourage attacks on critical infrastructure; the other relates to anti-LGBTQ+ activity. Investigators said they still have no evidence specifically tying the attack to the contemporaneous drag show, but the timing of the two incidents, as well as a general growth in tension around LGBTQ+ events, leads them to consider a possible connection.\n\nAftermath\nAs of December 6, it was estimated that about 35,000 Moore County residents were still without power, and the timeline for completing repairs and restoring power county-wide was revised from December 8 to midnight December 7. By the morning of December 7, the number of affected residents without power was down to about 23,000, and power had been restored to the Moore County hospital. Additionally, the Duke Energy website stated ""All substation equipment damaged from recent vandalism has either been fully repaired or replaced."" By 4 p.m. on December 7, the number of customers remaining without power had dropped to approximately 1,200. As a result, it was announced that the curfew would be permanently lifted as of 5 a.m. on the morning of December 8.A Moore County resident died during the power outage and investigators are determining whether the death was related to the outage, which could have implications for any criminal charges.As a result of the power outage, Moore County Regional Hospital was forced to operate on generator power. The town of Southern Pines also had to resort to operating their sewer and water services on backup generators. Residents of the area were asked to stay off the roads if possible or proceed with caution due to the absence of traffic lights.On December 4, a curfew was placed in effect for Moore County, from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. The nightly curfew was expected to remain in effect until the power was restored. A shelter was established at the Moore County Sports Complex, and Moore County schools were ordered closed from December 5 through December 8 as a result of the power outage.\n\nResponses\nDuring a press conference shortly after the attacks, Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields claimed the substations were targeted and that attack was intentional. Fields also claimed that the perpetrators most likely knew what they were doing but did not state that the attacks may have been domestic terrorism. The sheriff also reported that his office has not been able to tie anything back to a drag show in Southern Pines, scheduled around the time the power went out, thereby addressing a rumor that began on social media.U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby advised that the White House was monitoring the situation closely, and emphasized the importance of shoring up the security of the infrastructure.North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper issued a statement via Twitter, saying, ""An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.""\n\nSee also\n\nElectrical grid security in the United States\nMetcalf sniper attack\n\n\n== References ==']",,0.0,0.09302325581395349,0.7356352717995582
38,"Question: What caused the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023, and what were the consequences of the violence?","['On 3 May 2023, ethnic violence erupted in India\'s north-eastern state of Manipur between the Meitei people, a majority that lives in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki tribal community from the surrounding hills. As of 4 July, 142 people have been killed in the violence, with more than 300 wounded, and approximately 54,488 displaced.On 14 April 2023 a High Court had ordered, on a writ petition by the Metei Tribe Union, that the state government recommend Scheduled Tribe status for the valley-based Meitei community.  This order caused the All Tribal Students\' Union Manipur to organize mass rallies in all hills districts; and in one of these rallies, the demonstrators clashed with a group of people in a region bordering Bishnupur district followed by house burning.  For example, the Kuki people, who predominantly reside in the hill regions surrounding the capital valley, have been viewed as being the target of the present state government\'s treatment of Indigenous land rights concerns.  Majority of the Kuki people are Christian. There have been evictions in Kuki communities as a result of efforts to survey forests, which were ostensibly made to stop the cultivation of poppies.Also, the Meitei Indigenous community has also experienced a rise in insecurity as a result of the flood of refugees following the military coup in neighboring Myanmar in 2021, particularly those from the Sagaing region. The people most impacted in both communities are women and children, even yet those in charge of the firearms, drugs, and politicians make the real decisions in the fight. To further a few people\'s agenda, the identities of various ethnic communities have been weaponized in the ongoing struggle.According to several organisations, there have been accounts of partisan killings by security forces, as well as allegations of the police siding with the Meitei community.A panel led by a retired Chief Justice will investigate the violence, while a peace committee will be established under the Governor and security advisor Kuldeep Singh, along with members of civil society. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe six cases related to conspiracy in the violence, ensuring a neutral investigation to uncover the root causes.\n\nBackground\nManipur is a hill state in northeast India, bordering Myanmar to its east and south. The central area is the Imphal Valley occupying about 10% of the land area of the state, which is mainly populated by the Meitei people. All developmental activities are concentrated in the Imphal Valley. The surrounding hills which are undeveloped are inhabited by hill tribes, who are classified as Kukis in the southern portion and Nagas in the northeastern portion.The Meiteis, who are largely Hindus, make up 53% of the population. They are barred from settling in the hilly regions of the state except with the permission of the local district councils, as per the Land Reform Act of Manipur. The tribal population, consisting of predominantly Christian Kukis and the Nagas, forms about 40% of the state\'s 3.5 million people. They reside in the reserved hill regions consisting of the rest of the 90% of the state. The tribal population is not prohibited from settling in the valley region..Kukis state that they do not want to come to the valley but they have to since there are no roads no schools or hospitals in the hills.The Meiteis dominate political power in the Manipur Legislative Assembly.  Out of 60 seats in the Assembly, 19 seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST), i.e. for Naga or Kukis, while 40 are unreserved general constituencies, of which 39 seats were won by Meitei candidates in the last election. Tribal groups have complained that the government spending is unduly concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley.\n\n2023 escalation\nIn 2023, the state government in Manipur began to expel illegal immigrants from Myanmar from state-owned forest reserves. Tribal groups alleged that illegal immigration is a pretext under which the Meitei population wants to drive away the tribal population from their lands. In February 2023, the BJP state government began an eviction drive in districts of Churachandpur, Kangpokpi and Tengnoupal, declaring the forest dwellers as encroachers – a move seen as anti-tribal.In March, the Manipur Cabinet decided to withdraw from the Suspension of Operation agreements with three Kuki militant groups including the Kuki National Army and the Zomi Revolutionary Army, though the central government did not support such a withdrawal. Several Manipuri organisations also demonstrated in New Delhi to press for a National Register of Citizens (NRC) to be created with 1951 as the base year, complaining of abnormal population growth in hill areas. The first violence broke out as five people were injured in a clash in the Kangpokpi district, where protesters gathered to hold a rally against ""encroachment of tribal land in the name of reserved forests, protected forests and wildlife sanctuary"". While, the state cabinet stated that the government will not compromise on ""steps taken to protect the state government\'s forest resources and for eradicating poppy cultivation"". On 11 April, three churches in Imphal\'s Tribal Colony locality were razed for being illegal constructions on government land.On 20 April 2023, a judge of the Manipur High Court directed the state government to ""consider request of the Meitei community to be included in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list."" The Kukis feared that the ST status would allow the Meiteis purchase land in the prohibited hilly areas.The tribal groups called for a total shut down on 28 April in protest of the state government actions, a day that also happened to have been scheduled for the chief minister N. Biren Singh to visit Churachandpur for the inauguration of an open air gym. The day before the visit, a mob set fire to the gym and vandalised it. Section 144 (of the criminal procedure code) was invoked on 28 April as well as a five-day Internet shut down. The protesters clashed with the police and tear gas shells were used to disperse the mobs.CM Biren targeted Kukis on Twitter and TV channels even after the violence started in the state, leading to deepening already existing tensions between the communities. On 19 June, he labelled Kuki members with arms as ""millitants"" and said they will face consequences while appealed to armed Meiteis not to do anything illegal. On 29 June, he selectively targeted Kukis by labelling them ""terrorists"". In subsequent tweets, he called Kukis as Myanmarese and also invoked Chinese hand in the violence.\n\nOverview\nRiots\nAmidst the long-standing tensions between the Meitei and the Kuki people, a tribal organisation called the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM), opposed to the decision of the Manipur High Court, called for a march named the ""Tribal Solidarity March"" on 3 May, which turned violent in the district of Churachandpur. Reportedly, more than 60,000 protesters participated in this march.During the violence on 3 May, residence and churches of the mostly Kuki Tribal population were attacked in the non-tribal areas. According to the police, many houses of the tribal population in Imphal were attacked and 500 occupants were displaced and had to take shelter in Lamphelpat. Around 1000 Meiteis affected by the violence also had to flee from the region and take shelter in Bishnupur. Twenty houses were burnt in the city of Kangpokpi.  Violence was observed in Churachandpur, Kakching, Canchipur, Soibam Leikai, Tengnoupal, Langol, Kangpokpi and Moreh while mostly being concentrated in the Imphal Valley during which several houses, places of worship and other properties were burnt and destroyed.On 4 May, fresh cases of violence were reported. The police force had to fire several rounds of tear gas shells to control the rioters. Kuki MLA Vunzjagin Valte (BJP), who is the representative of the tribal headquarters of Churachandpur, was attacked during the riot']",,0.0,0.21739130434782608,0.7228106573424539
39,Question: What was the size and payload of the Chinese balloon that was spotted in North American airspace?,"['From January 28 to February 4, 2023, a high-altitude balloon owned by China was spotted in North American airspace, including Alaska, western Canada, and the contiguous United States. On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. Following a preliminary analysis of the debris in June, U.S. officials stated that the balloon carried intelligence gathering equipment but does not appear to have sent information back to China. U.S. president Biden described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars\' equivalent of spy equipment; his government said the balloon had a propeller for maneuverability.When the object was first spotted, the Pentagon characterized it as a surveillance balloon. The Chinese government maintained it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had been blown off course. According to U.S. officials, the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations. Analysts said that its flight path and structural characteristics were dissimilar from those of a typical weather balloon. American officials later disclosed that they had been tracking the balloon since it was launched from Hainan and its original destinations were likely Guam and Hawaii, but prevailing winds blew it off course and across North America.The incident increased U.S.–China tensions. The United States called the balloon\'s presence a violation of its sovereignty, and its Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a long-awaited diplomatic visit to Beijing. Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador in response to the incident.In the United States, three other high-altitude objects, over Northern Alaska (February 10), Yukon (February 11), and Lake Huron (February 11–12) respectively, were detected and subsequently shot down; a later assessment said they had no relation to China.\n\nBackground\nHistory and development of reconnaissance balloons\nBalloons have been valued for their ability to observe the battlefield and direct artillery. Their usage peaked during World War I, after which they were increasingly replaced by airplanes. During the Cold War, the United States sent hundreds of high-altitude balloons, ostensibly for ""meteorological survey"" under Project Genetrix, over China and other Eastern Bloc countries to gain intelligence on their nuclear capabilities, drawing their protests.Although mostly supplanted by surveillance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, balloons have retained some advantages, such as a lower cost of production and deployment. By 2019, the Pentagon had invested millions in COLD STAR (Covert Long Dwell Stratospheric Architecture), a project for stealthy balloons that are now being transitioned from narcotics surveillance into military service. China recognizes the importance of catching up to foreign countries in this domain. Its military publications have highlighted the use of balloons to assess the early warning and response capabilities of enemy air defenses and to enhance China\'s own defense capabilities.\n\nPast Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\nSuspected Chinese surveillance balloons had been detected in U.S. airspace in the past, namely over Guam, Hawaii, and Florida. One occurred earlier during Joe Biden\'s presidency (2021–present) and three occurred during Donald Trump\'s presidency (2017–2021). They did not persist as long as the 2023 incident, and China was able to recover those balloons.Other pre-2023 incursions have remained unexplained, classified by U.S. authorities as unidentified aerial phenomena. In 2022, the Office of the Director for National Intelligence said that there had been at least 171 reports of unexplained aerial phenomena in the United States, and the intelligence community has been unable to determine their precise nature. The commander of United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), General Glen VanHerck, said that U.S. failure to detect and identify all such incursions is ""a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out"". In response the U.S. changed the sensitivity of its radar detection systems, which enabled it to detect additional UFOs.The U.S. Department of State said that a fleet of Chinese balloons have flown over more than forty countries and linked the surveillance activity to the Chinese military. In 2020 and 2021, similar balloons were sighted in Sendai and Hachinohe, Japan respectively, but they were not identified as of Chinese origin at the time. A similar aircraft was sighted in January 2022 over India\'s strategically important Andaman and Nicobar islands. In February 2022, several balloons were detected off the coast of Taiwan, which their Ministry of National Defense said were likely for meteorological observations for the PLA\'s Eastern Theater Command. Another crashed near Taiwan in February 2023, carrying an antenna, a transmitter, temperature and humidity sensors, and was likely from China as well.\n\nU.S.–China tensions\nThe 2023 balloon incident occurred while U.S.–China relations were at their worst in decades, following suspected incidents of Chinese espionage and amid increasing strategic competition in military and economic sectors. In 2022, the United States, along with some of its allies, imposed stringent export controls on ""foundational technologies"", such as semiconductor microprocessors, to China in order to hamper the latter\'s development of advanced technology and military tools. The US has also sought to maintain critical supply chains independent from China.\n\nIncident\nBalloon\nSize, propulsion, and payload\nThe balloon carried an underslung payload described as a ""technology bay"" estimated to be the size of ""two or three school buses"" and was powered by sixteen solar arrays mounted on the payload. The balloon was 200 feet (61 m) tall according to U.S. General Glen D. VanHerck. AI startup Synthetaic, using image data from Planet Labs spacecraft, reported the balloon\'s diameter as 148 feet (45 m). USNORTHCOM and NORAD Commander, General Glen VanHerck, estimated the payload weighed more than 2,000 pounds (910 kg).The Chinese balloon was a superpressure balloon similar to earlier NASA designs, where the volume of the balloon is kept relatively constant in the face of changes in ambient pressure outside the balloon, and the temperature of the contained lifting gas. This allows better altitude control and much longer endurance compared to the more common variable-volume balloon design.\nNational Security Council spokesman Admiral John Kirby said the craft had a propeller and could be maneuvered. U.S. officials told foreign diplomats in Beijing that the craft had rudders and propellers. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said it had ""limited self-steering capability"".The U.S. Department of Defense said the balloon did not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground while it remained in the air, and that shooting it down over water would be safer and increased the opportunity to study the wreckage for intelligence purposes.Citing a PLA procurement portal, a U.S. official said that the balloon was manufactured by a civilian Chinese defense contractor.\n\nSignals intelligence capabilities\nExperts noted that weather balloons typically are about 20 feet (6 m) wide, less than a quarter of the balloon\'s diameter. Those interviewed by BBC News said it was unusual for weather balloons to last as long as the one involved in the incident and that the balloon ""might have been more sophisticated than China claims"".Images from U-2 flybys and forensic analysis of the payload showed antennas that likely were used for collecting and transmitting signals intelligence. A publicly released U.S. State Department document, after the balloon was downed and debris collected, said that the balloon\'']",,0.0,0.09615384615384616,0.7819807202616058

41,Question: When was GPT-4 released and what are some of its capabilities?,"['Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its numbered ""GPT-n"" series of GPT foundation models. It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ChatGPT), and with access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI\'s API being provided via a waitlist. As a transformer based model, GPT-4 was pretrained to predict the next token (using both public data and ""data licensed from third-party providers""), and was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback for human alignment and policy compliance.:\u200a2\u200aObservers reported the GPT-4 based version of ChatGPT to be an improvement on the previous (GPT-3.5 based) ChatGPT, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the same problems. Unlike the predecessors, GPT-4 can take images as well as text as input. OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the GPT-4 model.\n\nBackground\nOpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called ""Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training."" It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books. The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text. In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples. GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT. \nRumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.\n\nCapabilities\nOpenAI stated that GPT-4 is ""more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5."" They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively. Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input; this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the ""system message"", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to ""be a Shakespearean pirate"", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to ""always write the output of [its] response in JSON"", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces. For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model\'s prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance. The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to ""an hour or so"". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over Github Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.\n\nAptitude on standardized tests\nGPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile). In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd, 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.\nGPT-4 also passed an oncology exam, an engineering exam and a plastic surgery exam.\n\nMedical applications\nResearchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found ""that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B)"".A report by Microsoft has found that GPT-4 may act unreliably when used in the medical field. In their test example, GPT-4 added fabricated details to a patient\'s notes.In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4 powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.\n\nLimitations\nLike its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user\'s prompt.GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it\'s impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.\n\nBias\nGPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI\'s definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.\n\nTraining\nOpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that ""the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models"" were factors that influenced this decision.Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than $100 million. News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with ""eight people familiar with the inside story"" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.\n\nAlignment\nAccording to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

42,"Question: What is the current status of the Myanmar civil war, and how many people have been internally displaced since the coup?","['The Myanmar civil war (Burmese: ၂၀၂၁-၂၀၂၃ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံ ပြည်သူ့ခုခံတွန်းလှန်စစ်), also called the Myanmar Spring Revolution, and the People\'s Defensive War, is an ongoing civil war following Myanmar\'s long-running insurgencies which escalated significantly in response to the 2021 military coup d\'état and the subsequent violent crackdown on anti-coup protests.In the months following the coup, the opposition began to coalesce around the National Unity Government, which launched an offensive against the junta. By 2022, the opposition controlled substantial, though sparsely populated, territory. In many villages and towns, the junta\'s attacks drove out tens of thousands of people. On the second anniversary of the coup, in February 2023, the chairman of the State Administration Council, Min Aung Hlaing, admitted to losing stable control over ""more than a third"" of townships. Independent observers note the real number is likely far higher, with as few as 72 out of 330 townships and all major population centres remaining under stable control.As of September 2022, 1.3 million people have been internally displaced, and over 13,000 children have been killed. By March 2023, the UN estimated that since the coup, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed. UNOCHA said that over 40,000 people fled into neighboring countries.\n\nBackground\nOn the morning of 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, successfully deposed the elected Myanmar government in a coup, forming a military junta. Former president Win Myint, Aung San Suu Kyi, and several other members of the National League for Democracy were detained during early morning raids and Min Aung Hlaing was placed as the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services and de facto ruler of the nation.The exact motives behind the coup are unclear. In the leadup to the coup, the Tatmadaw claimed that the 2020 general elections had 8.6 million voter irregularities, but presented no evidence. The coup may have been a way to re-establish the military\'s long-reigning power over the country which ended ten years prior.The bloody repression of anti-coup demonstrations led to the creation of armed groups to fight the State Administration Council, the military junta. Gathered under the name of the People\'s Defence Force (PDF) and the orders of the National Unity Government (NUG), formed by former parliamentarians in office before the coup d\'état, the PDF and the NUG officially declared a ""defensive war"" against the military regime in September 2021. The ACLED estimated that as of 29 July 2022, around 23,521 people in total had been killed in the violence following the 2021 coup.\n\nExisting conflict\nInsurgencies have been ongoing in Myanmar since 1948 and have largely been ethnic-based. Communist insurgencies and the Karen National Union were the primary opposition actors to the central government. Over the 20th century, several prominent ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) rose and fell in influence and control. Larger rebel factions such as the Kachin Independence Army formed in response to Ne Win\'s 1962 Burmese coup d\'état and its increased political repression. The 8888 Uprising in response to the totalitarian rule of Ne Win resulted in some of the first modern Bamar militias forming from protestors heading to areas under ethnic rebel control.\nIn the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, later called the State Peace and Development Council, formed a military junta. The Tatmadaw severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds through the 1990s. By the time of the 2011–2015 Myanmar political reforms, the junta had regained control of many long-time rebel strongholds including Kokang and Karen State.As part of its political reforms and democratization, the 2008 Constitution created self-administered zones with increased autonomy. In 2015, the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between 8 EAOs and the central government. However, as soon as 2018, the NCA had already begun to fall apart due to alleged violations of the agreement by Tatmadaw soldiers entering EAO territories to build roads. Many non-signatories continued the conflict. In late 2016, four non-signatories of the NCA formed the Northern Alliance, including the Kachin Independence Army and Arakan Army, engaged in war with the central government and other EAOs.\n\nPrelude\nArmed protestors\nIn late March, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar\'s border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country\'s many insurgent groups, elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war. The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw also proposed the formation of a ""federal armed force"" to combat the military, and in late March the Arakan Army (AA) threatened to end its ceasefire with the military should the latter ""persist in massacring civilians"".During late March, protesters increasingly began arming themselves with homemade weapons such as guns in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. Simultaneously, clashes with soldiers and IED attacks against administrative buildings and police stations became more common as the trend of protesters using armed resistance rose.\n\nRenewed ethnic conflict\nThe unrest across the nation and the increased need for junta troops in previously peaceful urban areas strengthened EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has already been on the offensive against the military since February and seized the military base of Alaw Bum near the town of Laiza on 25 March. The next day, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) attacked a military base, killing 10 soldiers and taking others hostages in the first attack on the military since the protests began. The following day saw the 2021 Kalay clashes, the first openly armed resistance by protesters in the town of Kalay against the junta. Protestors used homemade weapons against soldiers and security forces attacking a protest camp.The military junta declared that it would cease all military operations on 29 March and hold bilateral negotiations with ethnic armed groups. However, the KIA continued its offensives stating that the Myanmar Army had continued operations as usual. Through April, the informal clashes intensified, such as on 8 April when protesters fought back against soldiers with hunting rifles and firebombs in a battle that resulted in 11 protesters\' deaths. The same day, the country surpassed 600 deaths related to anti-coup protests since 1 February.Seven insurgent groups who were signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement aligned themselves with the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, including the All Burma Student Democratic Front and the Karen National Union. The Northern Alliance, comprising the Arakan Army, the Ta\'ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, attacked a police station in Naungmon, Shan State, killing at least 10 police officers and indicating their disregard of the junta\'s call for a ceasefire. In response, on 11 April, the junta military launched a counter-attack to recapture the Alaw Bum base using airstrikes and ground troops, but had to retreat amidst heavy casualties.\n\nNew conflicts\nOn 26 April, the Battle of Mindat became one of the first large-scale conflicts arising from the 2021 coup. The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) began armed resistance in Mindat, Chin State. As a response, the junta cut off food and water supplies and declared martial law. Fighting began when a group of demonstrators outside the town\'s Aung San statue requested the release of six of their arrested colleagues, when a soldier of the regime allegedly fired at someone, prompting protesters to react.\nAccording to an aid worker, more than 10,000 people have left Mindat in southern Chin State as the Myanmar military star']",,0.0,0.02,0.7139779072018099

44,"Question: What was the cause of the rebellion staged by the Wagner Group in 2023, and how did it end?","['On 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian government-funded paramilitary and private military company, staged a rebellion after a period of increasing tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defence and the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. An agreement to settle this conflict was reached between the two sides the next day, 24 June 2023.\nWhile Prigozhin was supportive of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he had previously publicly criticized Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, blaming them for the country\'s military shortcomings and accusing them of handing over ""Russian territories"" to Ukraine. Prigozhin portrayed the rebellion as a response to an alleged attack on his forces by the ministry, and demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be turned over to him. In a televised address on 24 June, Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced Wagner\'s actions as treason and pledged to quell the rebellion.\nPrigozhin\'s forces took control of Rostov-on-Don and the headquarters of the Southern Military District in the city. An armored column of Wagner troops advanced through Voronezh Oblast towards Moscow. Armed with mobile anti-aircraft systems, the rebels repelled the air attacks of the Russian military, whose actions did not deter the progress of the column. Ground defenses were concentrated on the approach to Moscow. Before Wagner reached the defenses, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko brokered a settlement with Prigozhin, who agreed to end the rebellion. On the late evening of 24 June, Wagner forces turned around, and those that had remained in Rostov-on-Don began withdrawing.\nAs per the agreement, the Federal Security Service, which had initiated a case for armed rebellion under Article 279 of the Criminal Code closed the case on 27 June 2023, dropping the charges. At least thirteen servicemen of the Russian military were killed during the rebellion. On the rebels\' side, several Wagner members were reported injured and two military defectors were killed according to Prigozhin.\n\nBackground\nYevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\nIn the early 2000s, Prigozhin, having served a decade in prison before embarking on an entrepreneurial path, emerged as a prominent figure in Saint Petersburg\'s business landscape, gaining recognition for a string of highly regarded restaurants. This connection eventually facilitated a financial association with Putin, who was actively engaged in municipal politics during that period. Prigozhin gradually evolved into a trusted and intimate confidant of Putin, forging a close personal bond.In 2014, Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company. Despite the legal prohibition of private military companies in Russia, Wagner operated unimpeded with implicit endorsement and funding from the Russian government. Many analysts have said that the government employed Wagner services to allow for plausible deniability and to obscure the actual toll in terms of casualties and financial costs of Russia\'s foreign interventions.Serving as a tool of Russian foreign and military policy, Wagner emerged as a formidable combat force in various regions, including the Donbas conflict. It played a significant role during Russia\'s military intervention in the Syrian civil war, providing support to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and has participated in conflicts in Mali, Libya, and the Central African Republic. Wagner has garnered infamy due to its ruthless methods and its participation in war crimes throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Ukraine, perpetrating atrocities with impunity.The group maintains close ties with multiple African governments, enjoying considerable autonomy to exploit the natural resources of these nations in return for supporting local forces in their battle against anti-government rebels. Wagner\'s economic endeavors in Africa witnessed an upward trajectory even amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as the funds generated were channeled towards financing the conflicts in Ukraine and other regions.\n\nInternal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\nOrder to integrate Wagner\nIn mid-June 2023, the MoD ordered Wagner to sign contracts with the military before 1 July. This move effectively integrated Wagner as a subordinate unit within the regular command structure, thereby diminishing the influence of Prigozhin. However, Prigozhin declined to sign the agreement, alleging incompetence on the part of Shoigu. Reports from the independent Russian news outlet Meduza indicated that this development would undermine Prigozhin\'s hold over Wagner and jeopardize the group\'s profitable operations in Africa. Prigozhin unsuccessfully attempted to circumvent the order for Wagner\'s subordination while intensifying his criticism of the MoD. He went as far as advocating for the execution of Shoigu and hinting at a potential popular uprising against inept officials. Prigozhin believed that Putin would ultimately side with him in his struggle against the MoD if he launched a mutiny.\n\nPlanning the rebellion\nU.S. intelligence agencies observed a gradual accumulation of Wagner forces near the Russian border along with evidence of Wagner stockpiling equipment and resources in preparation for the rebellion. Although they obtained information regarding the where and how of the planned rebellion, the exact timing remained unknown. Western intelligence agencies reportedly uncovered the plan through communications intercepts and satellite image analysis. Several weeks prior to the actual event, U.S. intelligence started foreseeing a significant Wagner insurrection and obtained solid evidence of the imminent rebellion before 21 June. Prigozhin seemed to have set the plan in motion following the MoD decision on 10 June, which would effectively integrate Wagner forces into the regular military. The foreign intelligence findings indicate that the revolt was planned in advance, contradicting Prigozhin\'s claim that the decision to rebel was made on 23 June.Anonymous U.S. officials later disclosed to The New York Times that Army General Sergey Surovikin had prior knowledge of the planned rebellion. Surovikin had acted as an intermediary between Prigozhin and the military hierarchy and was perceived to have close ties to Prigozhin. CNN obtained documents that indicated Surovikin had a personal registration number with Wagner and held a covert VIP membership within the group, alongside at least 30 other high-ranking Russian military and intelligence officials. Additionally, there were indications that other generals may have lent their support to the uprising. U.S. officials asserted that Prigozhin would not have instigated the rebellion unless he harbored the belief that he had backing from specific sectors within the Russian power structure.According to disclosures by Western officials to the The Wall Street Journal, the Russian Federal Security Service discovered the plan two days before it was scheduled to be executed. The discovery of the plan led to the premature start of the rebellion. Prigozhin intended to capture Defense Minister Shoigu and chief of general staff Gerasimov during their planned joint visit to the southern region of Russia that borders Ukraine and Western officials said the plan had a good chance of success had it not been discovered, leading Prigozhin to improvise an alternative plan. Western officials said intelligence findings indicated that Prigozhin\'s plan rested on his belief that a part of the armed forces would join the rebellion. Western official said they believe Prigozhin informed some senior military offices about his plan. Commander of the Russian National Guard Viktor Zolotov has claimed that Russian authorities learned about the planned rebellion and that it would be executed between June 22 and June 25. According to anonymous accounts conveyed by Meduza, it\'s possible that the security services ""didn’t have the nerve to tell the president that something']",,0.0,0.36,0.7252157302947831
45,"Question: What caused the gas supply outage in Sheffield, England in December 2022, and how long did the outage last?","['The city of Sheffield, England was impacted by a major failure of the local natural gas supply network in December 2022, resulting in a loss of central heating and gas stove availability to more than 3,000 properties in the northwestern suburbs of the city. The outage, which has predominantly affected the Hillsborough, Malin Bridge and Stannington districts, was declared a major incident by Sheffield City Council; some properties were without a gas supply for almost two weeks.\nThe gas supply outage affected the Cadent Gas network, and was caused by a burst water main on the Yorkshire Water network which resulted in more than 2 million litres of water flooding into the gas supply network. Yorkshire Water confirmed that the breach to the water main had been resolved by 6 December. In addition to the widespread gas supply outage, numerous properties in the affected areas have also suffered from outages to their water and electricity supplies as knock-on effects.Heavy rainfall initially hampered recovery work, followed by cold temperatures and snowfall. In response to the widespread lack of heating availability and increasingly cold temperatures, dropping as low as −3 °C (27 °F) on 9 December, a major incident was declared by local authorities. The Red Cross distributed aid, including food, drinks and blankets, to residents in the affected area.\n\nTimeline\nDuring the evening of 2 December, a water main on Bankfield Lane at the western end of Stannington burst, resulting in flooding in the local area. The affected water main was an asbestos-cement mainline pipe installed in 1970. More than 2 million litres of water, roughly equivalent to three Olympic-sized swimming pools, entered the gas mains in this area and subsequently flowed through pipes down hillsides throughout the Stannington and Hillsborough areas.Property damage was reported in dozens of homes across the affected area, including on High Matlock Road, as water overflowed out of gas meters and gas stoves inside homes; water also overflowed out of manhole covers and the bases of street lights in outdoor areas. Emergency services attended the incident from around midnight, going from door to door to wake residents. Cadent Gas, who operate the natural gas network in the area, described the incident as ""unpredecented"" and something which they had never had to deal with before.By 3 December more than 1,000 properties were without a gas supply; in addition, many properties in the immediate area of the burst water main also suffered from reduced water supplies, or no water at all, for several days. Engineers from Cadent Gas initially had to go from door to door and turn off the gas supply at each individual affected property, before engineers could commence work to drain and repair the gas network; more than 100 engineers were drafted in to work 24 hours a day to resolve the outage, later rising to more than 200 as the incident progressed.The number of properties affected by the gas supply outage rose to more than 2,000 by 6 December, increasingly affecting homes lower down the hillside in the Hillsborough area of Sheffield. Local electricity network operator Northern Powergrid warned local residents to only use portable electric heaters in occupied rooms and only while residents were at home, in order to reduce strain on the local power supply caused by increased usage of electric heating. Despite this however, residents on some streets in Stannington began to report intermittent power outages throughout the day. Electric car owners were advised to use public charging points rather than those at their own homes.The local authority, Sheffield City Council, officially declared a major incident on 7 December, with thousands of properties still without a gas supply and temperatures forecast to drop below freezing for prolonged periods in the coming days. Only around a quarter of affected properties had had their gas supplies reconnected at the time that the major incident was declared, according to Cadent Gas, as their engineers were struggling to pump the large quantities of water out of the complex local gas network; engineers and equipment were shipped in from across the country to assist in draining the network.According to Cadent Gas, around three-quarters of affected properties had been reconnected to the gas network by 10 December. Considerable difficulties remained in draining water from the gas network in the Hillsborough and Malin Bridge areas, where hundreds of homes still remained without gas.\n\nResponse\nRefuge spaces were opened officially by the local authorities and unofficially by local businesses, providing warm spaces, hot food and drinks to affected residents. The primary official refuge was opened at Lomas Hall, a church hall on Church Street in Stannington, where residents were issued with portable electric heaters and electric hotplates for cooking. The Peacock Inn pub on Stannington Road opened to provide residents with food and hot drinks, while the nearby Crown & Glove pub on Uppergate Road opened to provide showering facilities.Schools in the affected areas remained open, despite the interruption to their gas supplies; individual classrooms were heated using portable electric heaters, and Nook Lane Junior School advised parents to send children to school wearing additional warm clothing and with a packed lunch due to the unavailability of their kitchen facilities.The Liberal Democrat councillor for the Stannington ward, Penny Baker, praised local residents for showing resilience and ""community spirit"" by coming together in the face of the crisis. Terry Fox, the leader of Sheffield City Council, declared a major incident on 7 December, stating that it would allow the local authorities to ""better co-ordinate the overall response"" to the crisis.Olivia Blake, the Labour Member of Parliament for the Sheffield Hallam constituency in which Stannington is located, raised the gas supply outage during a debate in the House of Commons on 7 December, asking for direct government assistance and emergency funding.\n\nAftermath\nYorkshire Water issued an apology to affected customers on 6 December, stating that they ""understood how difficult it was"" for affected residents. The water company was criticised for their part in causing the crisis, although a spokesperson maintained that the affected water main had previously been in a good condition and had not suffered any problems in more than a decade. Cadent Gas initially announced that residents would be compensated for any extra electricity usage caused by increased usage of portable electric heaters and other devices, before confirming that affected residents would receive double the usual rate of compensation for a gas outage, totalling £910 for a seven-day outage (or £1,470 for a commercial property).Angry local residents interrupted a news conference being held by Yorkshire Water director Neil Dewis in Stannington on 9 December, heckling him and accusing the company of not taking the situation seriously. Residents claimed that there had been up to ten recent burst water mains in the Stannington area prior to the major incident, accusing Yorkshire Water of providing inadequate maintenance. In contrast, efforts by Cadent Gas and Northern Powergrid to deal with the crisis were praised by local residents.Cadent appointed Aspect Maintenance from London as major contractor to replace hundreds of damaged gas appliances by 45 Engineers working 12 hours each day 7 days a week for 4 months.\n\n\n== References ==']",,0.0,0.3125,0.7273626583653249
46,"Question: What sparked the civil unrest and protests in Iran in September 2022, and what were the main demands of the protesters?","['Civil unrest and protests against the government of Iran associated with the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini (Persian: مهسا امینی) began on 16 September 2022 and are ongoing as of July 2023. Amini had been arrested by the Guidance Patrol for allegedly violating Iran\'s mandatory hijab law by wearing her hijab ""improperly"" while visiting Tehran from Saqqez. According to eyewitnesses, she had been severely beaten by Guidance Patrol officers, an assertion denied by Iranian authorities. As the protests spread from Amini\'s hometown of Saqqez to other cities in the Iranian Kurdistan and throughout Iran, the government responded with widespread Internet blackouts, nationwide restrictions on social media usage, tear gas and gunfire.Although the protests have not been as deadly as those in 2019 (when more than 1,500 were killed), they have been ""nationwide, spread across social classes, universities, the streets [and] schools"", and called the ""biggest challenge"" to the government of Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. At least 537 people, including 68 minors, had been killed as a result of the government\'s intervention in the protests, as of 4 April 2023.  An estimated 19,262 have been arrested throughout at least 134 cities and towns, and at 132 universities.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the widespread unrest not only as ""riots"" but also as a ""hybrid war"" caused by foreign states and dissidents abroad. Women, including schoolchildren, have played a key role in the demonstrations. In addition to demands for increased rights for women, the protests have demanded the overthrow of the Islamic Republic, setting them apart from previous major protest movements in Iran, which have focused on election results or economic woes. \nThe government\'s response to the protests has been widely condemned.\n\nHistorical background\nSince shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iranian women have been legally required to completely cover their hair in public with a hijab. Enforcement of the unpopular law was eased during the 2013–2021 tenure of President Rouhani, but was then intensified under Rouhani\'s successor, the hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi.  Bloody Aban  (Persian: آبان خونین), a month near November in the Iranian calendar, was a series of 2019 protests initially caused by a 50–200% increase in fuel prices, and as part of the wider Iranian Democracy Movement, leading to calls for the overthrow of the government in Iran and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nMahsa Amini\'s arrest and death in custody\nMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was arrested by the Guidance Patrol on 14 September 2022 because of an ""improper hijab."" The police were accused of beating her and inflicting a fatal head injury; Amini was pronounced dead on 16 September. After a CT scan confirmed that Amini had sustained head injuries, the head of the Guidance Patrol was allegedly suspended, a claim that was denied by Tehran police.\n\nProtests\nInitial protests, mostly led by women, demanded an end to the mandatory hijab; these protests evolved into a national revolt. The protests became more widespread than those of 2009, 2017, and 2019, encompassing even Islamic Republic power bases such as the holy cities of Mashhad and Qom. Unlike some previous protests, the new protests involved both urban middle classes and rural working areas. In addition, schoolgirls demonstrated in numbers for the first time. While continuing to protest Amini\'s death and demanding an end to the mandatory hijab, Iranians also advocated for wider freedoms and women\'s rights, and protested against the morality police, the Ayatollah, and the theocratic regime.Unlike many previous Iranian protests, protesters appear to be demanding a wholesale change in government rather than limiting themselves to incremental reforms. In a November 2022 Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran (GAMAAN) poll, almost three-quarters of Iranians opposed mandatory hijab; of these anti-hijabis, 84% would prefer a secular Iranian state to theocracy, which GAMAAN characterized as an endorsement of regime change. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, economic hardship and poor living conditions contributed to the growth of the protests. The New York Times itemized Iranian grievances such as ""soaring prices, high unemployment, corruption, (and) political repression"", and identified the poor Iranian economy as a major force behind the protests; according to an Iranian report in August 2021, a third of Iranians live in poverty. Abdolreza Davari, a conservative analyst, has quoted a statistic that 95 percent of Iranians are ""worried about their livelihoods today and for their and their children\'s future."" Only 15% of Iranians in the job market are women. Iran ranked 143rd out of 146 countries in the 2022 WEF Gender Gap Report, due in part to prohibitions on female membership in powerful government organizations.In response to the protests, people held demonstrations in support of the government across several cities in Iran, in an attempt to counter the protests. The Iranian government referred to these counter-protests as ""spontaneous"". The pro-government protesters called for the anti-government protesters to be executed, and referred to them as ""Israel\'s soldiers"" whilst shouting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"", reflecting Iran\'s clerical rulers\' usual narrative of putting the blame of the unrest on foreign countries.Media coverage was constrained by Iranian restrictions on speech, including Internet shutdowns and arrests of journalists. NBC News retained a correspondent in Tehran. Most Western outlets obtained information from networks of contacts, human rights groups, and social media content. According to BBC News, an Iranian government disinformation campaign produced social media videos and fake interviews, and attempted to trick Western media into reporting falsehoods: ""They can then say foreign media is reporting fake news"".According to France 24, protests ""had dwindled"" across most of the country by March 2023.\n\nAftermath\nEvents of chain poisoning in girls\' schools occurred.\nThe state began a surveillance program.\n\nActions by protesters\nProtesters often stage small and quick, but numerous, ""flash mob"" gatherings. Drivers have blocked streets with their cars to slow down security forces; roads have also been blocked by dumpster bins or even overturned police cars. Security forces on motorbikes cut through traffic, with passengers firing on protesters. In some cases security forces used paintballs to mark demonstrators; some demonstrators packed extra clothes to replace painted clothes, wore masks to avoid identification, or dismantled public security cameras. Some protesters chanted from windows or rooftops. Symbolic protests include dyeing fountains blood-red, and women discarding and burning their hijabs or cutting their hair in public. Since turbans are viewed as a symbol of the regime, some activists engaged in turban throwing (knocking the turbans off of ""privileged"" Iranian clerics on the street and running away); reformers such as Ahmad Zaidabadi criticized the trend, and said the practice can harass uninvolved scholars.\n\nCivil boycotts\nSome university teachers and professors declared their support for the student movement by boycotting classes or resigning. They included Nasrollah Hekmat (Shahid Beheshti University), Ammar Ashoori (Islamic Azad University), Lili Galehdaran (Shiraz Art University) and Gholamreza Shahbazi (Art and Soureh Universities), together with Alireza Bahraini, Shahram Khazaei, and Azin Movahed (Sharif University of Technology, Tehran).On December 5 to 7, 2022, a general strike took place to put pressure on the regime.\n\nSlogans\nDemonstrators used slogans and banners that directly criticized the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Khamenei. Protesters showed strong opposition to human rights violations perpetrated by Iran\'s Guidance Patrol. ""Wo']",,0.0,0.2037037037037037,0.7156712958687613
47,"Question: What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","['The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanic features and has more volcanoes than any other planet in the Solar System. It has a surface that is 90% basalt, and about 65% of the planet consists of a mosaic of volcanic lava plains, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. There are more than 1,000 volcanic structures and possible periodic resurfacing of Venus by floods of lava. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Venus has an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, with a density that is 90 times that of Earth\'s atmosphere.\nThere are over 80,000 volcanoes on Venus detected through radar mapping. For many years scientists debated on whether Venus was currently active or if the volcanic structures were remnants from the past. There are few impact craters on Venus\' surface which pointed to relatively recent resurfacing. The most likely resurfacing event would have been volcanic flows.  Radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus\'s highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. Although many lines of evidence such as this suggest that volcanoes on Venus have been recently active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, other more recent studies, in January 2020, suggest that Venus, though not Maat Mons specifically, is indeed currently volcanically active. In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the Magellan orbiter. Using computer simulations they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause. Until 2023 there had only been hints of active volcanism; announced in March 2023 scientists imaged a vent expanding in Magellan images which is the proof needed to announce active volcanism\n\nTypes of volcanoes\nVenus has shield volcanoes, widespread lava flows and some unusual volcanoes called pancake domes and ""tick-like"" structures which are not present on Earth. Pancake dome volcanoes are up to 15 km (9.3 mi) in diameter and less than 1 km (0.62 mi) in height and are 100 times larger than lava domes formed on Earth. They are usually associated with coronae and tesserae (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions, which are unique to Venus). The pancakes are thought to be formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus\'s high atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe ""tick-like"" structures are called scalloped margin domes. They are commonly called ticks because they appear as domes with numerous legs. They are thought to have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. Sometimes deposits of debris can be seen scattered around them.\n\nOn Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes.  The shield volcanoes, for example those in Hawaii, eject magma from the depths of the Earth in zones called hot spots.  The lava from these volcanoes is relatively fluid and permits the escape of gases.  Composite volcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates.  In this type of volcano, the oceanic crust of one plate is sliding underneath the other in a subduction zone, together with an inflow of seawater, producing a gummier lava that restricts the exit of the gases, and for that reason, composite volcanoes tend to erupt more violently.\n\nOn Venus, where there are no tectonic plates or seawater, volcanoes are mostly of the shield type. Nevertheless, the morphology of volcanoes on Venus is different: on Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometres wide and up to 10 km (6.2 mi) high in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometres in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of 1.5 km (0.93 mi). Large volcanoes cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward because of their enormous vertical loads, producing flexural moats and/or ring fractures around the edifices. Large volcano edifice loading also causes magma chambers to fracture in a sill-like pattern, affecting magma propagation beneath the surface.Other unique features of Venus\'s surface are novae (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and arachnoids. A nova is formed when large quantities of magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where there may also be a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber.\nArachnoids are so named because they resemble a spider\'s web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures similar to those of a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as arachnoids actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes.\n\nRecent volcanic activity\nVolcanism on Venus has taken place within the last 2.5 million years; however, until recently there had been no absolute proof that any volcano on Venus has erupted recently. Recent radar imagery shows more than 1,000 volcanic structures and evidence of possible periodic resurfacing of the planet by floods of lava. In addition to the radar images, there is supporting evidence that volcanism has taken place, including an unusual change in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas in the upper atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is an important component of volcanic outgassing.  However, the sulphur dioxide in the lower atmosphere remains stable. This could mean that a change in the global atmosphere caused the sulphur dioxide concentration to increase above the clouds.  Even though the change in the atmosphere may be evidence that there have been volcanoes that erupted in Venus, it is difficult to determine whether they occurred or not.  In March 2014, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was located, in the form of infrared ""flashes"" over the edges of rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Sapas Mons. These flashes were detectable during two or three consecutive Earth days in 2008 and 2009 and are thought to be caused either by hot gases or lava released from volcanic eruptions. Scientists suspect that there are four volcanoes that may be active: Maat Mons, Ozza Mons, Sapas Mons and Idunn Mons.In 2020, a study by University of Maryland supported by Swiss National Science Foundation and NASA discovered that 37 of Venus\'s coronae show signs of ongoing activity. Maryland professor Laurent Montesi said, ""we are able to point to specific structures and say \'Look, this is not an ancient volcano but one that is active today, dormant perhaps, but not dead...\'"" The active coronae are clustered near each other, so positioning geologic survey instruments would now be easier.In March 2023, at the 54th Lunar Planetary Science Conference, a team revealed the first images of volcanic activity on the surface of Venus. The announcement consisted of two radar images from different cycles of Magellan data (8 months apart) that displayed a volcanic vent that had expanded by almost 2 square kilometers. This data was over 30 years old at the time of this discovery. The scientists checked that this expansion could not be explained by the angle at which the images were taken through computer simulations which revealed that the change must be structural.\n\nLightning\nLightning on Venus may serve as a diagnostic of volcanism or atmospheric convection, so some effort has been devoted to detecting possible lightning on Venus. No lightning has been directly observed, but the most compelling evidence is the very low frequency (VLF) radio emissions recorded beneath the c']",,0.0,0.125,0.7353981530886206
48,Question: What are some measures for pandemic prevention?,"['Pandemic prevention is the organization and management of preventive measures against pandemics. Those include measures to reduce causes of new infectious diseases and measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics from becoming pandemics.\nIt is not to be mistaken for pandemic preparedness or mitigation (e.g. against COVID-19) which largely seek to mitigate the magnitude of negative effects of pandemics, although the topics may overlap with pandemic prevention in some respects.\nSome biosafety and public health researchers contend that certain pandemic prevention efforts themselves carry risk of triggering pandemics (e.g. wildlife virus sampling), though not engaging in any form of sampling also carries the risk of being unprepared for future spillover events and being unaware of future pandemic pathogens.\n\nHistory\n2002–2004 SARS outbreak\nDuring the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV-1 virus was prevented from causing a pandemic of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. Human-to-human transmission of SARS may be considered eradicated, however, it could re-emerge as SARS-CoV-1 probably persists as a potential zoonotic threat in its original animal reservoir. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia. Effective isolation of patients was enough to control spread because infected individuals usually do not transmit the virus until several days after symptoms begin and are most infectious only after developing severe symptoms.\n\nMERS-CoV/NeoCoV alert\nIn January 2022, Chinese scientists at the Wuhan University and other institutions reported in a preprint the detection of the closest MERS-CoV relative in bats to date, NeoCoV, and another virus, PDF-2180-CoV, that can efficiently use bats\' ACE2 for cell entry. The study, now published in Nature found that one mutation could result in a theoretical \'MERS-CoV-2\' that, like SARS-CoV-2, can use humans\' ACE2 receptor. The theoretical virus could also have a high mortality burden, since MERS-CoV had a case fatality rate of around 35%. This \'MERS-CoV-2\' therefore represents a risk to biosafety and potential zoonotic spillover. The study emphasized the need for pathogen/spillover surveillance to further understand any possible threat from related viruses. The WHO stated that further study is needed to find out ""whether the virus detected in the study will pose a risk for humans"".\n\nMonkeypox\nOn 21 May 2022, the WHO reported on the international 2022 monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic countries which involved an unprecedented number of cases detected outside of Africa. The first of these cases was detected on 6 May 2022. The main method used for early containment (see below) is \'ring vaccination\' – vaccinating close contacts of positive cases via already-existing vaccines alongside pre-exposure vaccination of members of the public at higher risk.\n\nMeasures\nInfrastructure and international development\nRobust, collaborating public health systems that have the capacity for active surveillance for early detection of cases and to mobilize their health care coordination capacity may be required to be able stop contagion promptly. After an outbreak there is a certain window of time during which a pandemic can still be stopped by the competent authorities isolating the first infected and/or fighting the pathogen. A good global infrastructure, consequent information exchange, minimal delays due to bureaucracy and effective, targeted treatment measures can be prepared. In 2012 it has been proposed to consider pandemic prevention as an aspect of international development in terms of health-care infrastructure and changes to the pathogen-related dynamics between humans and their environment including animals. Often local authority carers or doctors in Africa, Asia or Latin America register uncommon accumulations (or clusterings) of symptoms but lack options for more detailed investigations. Scientists state that ""research relevant to countries with weaker surveillance, lab facilities and health systems should be prioritized"" and that ""in those regions, vaccine supply routes should not rely on refrigeration, and diagnostics should be available at the point of care"". Two researchers have suggested that public health systems ""in each country"" need to be capable of detecting contagion early, diagnosing it accurately, implementing effective disease control measures, and fully collaborating with the relevant international authorities at each stage (see below). U.S. officials have proposed a range of reforms to international health regulations and global institutions for global health security. The ""entire architecture of the response to epidemics"" may need to get adapted, evolving ""from crisis response during discrete outbreaks to an integrated cycle of preparation, response and recovery"" (see also #International coordination).\n\nTechnology-centric measures\nBiosafety technologies and biotechnology regulation\nPotential policies that support global biosafety could make use of various technologies, including but not limited to laboratory containment technologies – for example, tools could promote compliance with existing and novel biosecurity norms and standards. Proposals to increase biosafety in terms of laboratories, scientific field work and research and development-related activities include:\n\nlimiting research on highly contagious biological agents to only trained researchers in well-protected environments and advanced biological safety systems and disposal of biohazards.\nimproving physical security and educating scientists about the misuse potentials\nreview processes that ensure risks are justified and minimized, such as preventing certain gain-of-function studies (the exact definition of ""gain-of-function"" is contested and there also the term ""enhanced potential pandemic pathogens""). Arguments for gain-of-function-type research may include ""that vaccines and therapeutics can be pre-emptively researched and developed"" this way.\nmonitoring and strengthening laboratory protocols around the worldWork on coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was carried out at biosafety level 2 with level 4 being the most secure. Level 3 containment is now recommended for SARS-CoV-2. As of 2020, the CDC and other health agencies recommended handling non-SARS non-MERS human coronaviruses and SARS-related coronaviruses from wild animals at Biosafety Level 2 in vitro and Level 3 in vivo.\nAccording to a study of Indian BSL-2 and BSL-3 facilities, ""there are no national guidelines or reference standards available in India on certification and validation of biosafety laboratories""\nIn a 2018 study it was suggested that there is a need ""to update international laboratory biosafety guidance"" ""to globalize biosafety""\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic there was a ""global surge in labs that handle dangerous pathogens"" and as of 2022 some researchers ""are concerned about [these]"".\nmonitoring and strengthening field work protocols around the world (such as viral sampling)The so far closest known relative virus (with a 96.8% similarity) to SARS-CoV-2 was found in samples from wild horseshoe bats in/at caves in northern Laos. No SARS-CoV-2 related viruses could be found in any samples collected in China, including from the only two domestic caves where RaTG13 and RmYN02 were detected, indicating such viruses may currently not circulate in bats in the country. A study of wild animals sampled in and around Wuhan at the beginning of COVID-19 emergence did not find SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor virus in these samples. However, a virologist noted that their ""sample sizes are not large enough"" – 334 bats instead of ""tens of thousands of bats"".

49,Question: What are the main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter and what moons will it study?,"['The JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (Juice, formerly JUICE) is an interplanetary spacecraft that was launched on 14 April 2023 from Guiana Space Centre in the French Guiana by the European Space Agency (ESA) with Airbus Defence and Space as the main contractor. The mission is planned to study Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, three of Jupiter\'s Galilean moons. They are thought to have significant bodies of liquid water beneath their icy surfaces which would make them potentially habitable environments.The spacecraft was launched on 14 April 2023 at 12:14:36 UTC and is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031 after four gravity assists and eight years of travel. In December 2034, the spacecraft will enter orbit around Ganymede for its close-up science mission. Its period of operations will overlap with NASA\'s Europa Clipper mission, launching in 2024.\n\nBackground\nThe mission started as a reformulation of the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter proposal, which was to be ESA\'s component of the cancelled Europa Jupiter System Mission – Laplace (EJSM-Laplace). It became a candidate for the first L-class mission (L1) of the ESA Cosmic Vision Programme, and its selection was announced on 2 May 2012.In April 2012, JUICE was recommended over the proposed Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) X-ray telescope and a gravitational wave observatory (New Gravitational wave Observatory (NGO)).In July 2015, Airbus Defence and Space was selected as the prime contractor to design and build the probe, to be assembled in Toulouse, France.\n\nSpacecraft\nThe main spacecraft design drivers are related to the large distance to the Sun, the use of solar power, and Jupiter\'s harsh radiation environment. The orbit insertions at Jupiter and Ganymede and the large number of flyby manoeuvres (more than 25 gravity assists, and two Europa flybys) require the spacecraft to carry about 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of chemical propellant.JUICE has a fixed 2.5 meter diameter high-gain antenna and a steerable medium-gain antenna, both X- and K-band will be used. Downlink rates of 2 Gb/day are possible with ground-based Deep Space Antennas. On-board data storage capability is 1.25 Tb.The JUICE main engine is a hypergolic bi-propellant (mono-methyl hydrazine and mixed oxides of nitrogen) 425 N thruster. A 100 kg multilayer insulation provides thermal control. The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using momentum wheels. Radiation shielding is used to protect onboard electronics from the Jovian environment.The JUICE science payload has a mass of 280 kg and includes the JANUS camera system, the MAJIS visible and infrared imaging spectrometer, the UVS ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, RIME radar sounder, GALA laser altimeter, SWI submillimetre wave instrument, J-MAG magnetometer, PEP particle and plasma package, RPWI radio and plasma wave investigation, 3GM radio science package, the PRIDE radio science instrument, and the RADEM radiation monitor. A 10.6-meter deployable boom will hold J-MAG and RPWI, a 16-meter-long deployable antenna will be used for RIME. Four 3-meter booms carry parts of the RPWI instrument. The other instruments are mounted on the spacecraft body, or for 3GM, within the spacecraft bus.\n\nTimeline\nLaunch\nJUICE was launched into space on 14 April 2023 from the Guiana Space Centre on an Ariane 5 rocket. This was the final launch of an ESA science mission using the Ariane 5 vehicle, and was the second to last launch of the rocket overall.The launch was originally scheduled for 13 April 2023, but due to poor weather the launch was postponed. The next day a second launch attempt succeeded, with liftoff occurring at 12:14:36 UTC. After the spacecraft separated from the rocket, it established a successful radio signal connection with the ground at 13:04 UTC. JUICE\'s solar arrays were deployed about half an hour later, prompting ESA to deem the launch a success.\n\nTrajectory\nFollowing the launch, there will be multiple planned gravity assists to put JUICE on a trajectory to Jupiter: a flyby of the Earth–Moon system in August 2024, Venus in August 2025, second flyby of Earth in September 2026, and a third and final flyby of Earth in January 2029.JUICE will pass through the asteroid belt twice. A flyby of the asteroid 223 Rosa has been proposed, and could occur in October 2029.Gravity assists include:\nInterplanetary transfer (Earth, Venus, Earth, Earth)\nJupiter orbit insertion and apocentre reduction with multiple Ganymede gravity assists\nReduction of velocity with Ganymede–Callisto assists\nIncrease inclination with 10–12 Callisto gravity assists\n\nArrival at the Jovian system\nWhen it arrives in Jupiter\'s system in July 2031, JUICE will first perform a flyby of Ganymede in preparation for Jupiter orbital insertion about 7.5 hours later. The first orbit will be elongated, with subsequent orbits gradually lowered over time, resulting in a circular orbit around Jupiter.The first Europa flyby will take place in July 2032. JUICE will enter a high inclination orbit to allow exploration of Jupiter\'s polar regions and to study Jupiter\'s magnetosphere.\n\nOrbital insertion on Ganymede\nIn December 2034, JUICE will enter an elliptical orbit around Ganymede. The first orbit will be at a distance of 5,000 km (3,100 mi). In 2035, JUICE will enter a circular orbit 500 km (310 mi) above the surface of Ganymede. JUICE will study Ganymede\'s composition and magnetosphere among other things.\n\nPlanned deorbit on Ganymede\nWhen the spacecraft consumes its remaining propellant, JUICE is planned to be deorbited and impact Ganymede at the end of 2035.\n\nScience objectives\nThe JUICE orbiter will perform detailed investigations on Ganymede and evaluate its potential to support life. Investigations of Europa and Callisto will complete a comparative picture of these Galilean moons. The three moons are thought to harbour internal liquid water oceans, and so are central to understanding the habitability of icy worlds.\nThe main science objectives for Ganymede, and to a lesser extent for Callisto, are:\nCharacterisation of the ocean layers and detection of putative subsurface water reservoirs\nTopographical, geological and compositional mapping of the surface\nStudy of the physical properties of the icy crusts\nCharacterisation of the internal mass distribution, dynamics and evolution of the interiors\nInvestigation of Ganymede\'s tenuous atmosphere\nStudy of Ganymede\'s intrinsic magnetic field and its interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere.For Europa, the focus is on the chemistry essential to life, including organic molecules, and on understanding the formation of surface features and the composition of the non-water-ice material. Furthermore, JUICE will provide the first subsurface sounding of the moon, including the first determination of the minimal thickness of the icy crust over the most recently volcanically active regions.\nMore distant spatially resolved observations will also be carried out for several minor irregular satellites and the volcanically active moon Io.\n\nScience instruments\nOn 21 February 2013, after a competition, 11 science instruments were selected by ESA, which were developed by science and engineering teams from all over Europe, with participation from the US. Japan also contributed several components for SWI, RPWI, GALA, PEP, JANUS and J-MAG instruments, and will facilitate testing.\nJovis, Amorum ac Natorum Undique Scrutator (JANUS)The name is Latin for ""comprehensive observation of Jupiter, his love affairs and descendants."" A camera system to image Ganymede and interesting parts of the surface of Callisto at better than 400 m/pixel (resolution limited by mission data volume). Selected targets will be investigated in high-resolution with a spatial resolution from 25 m/pixel down to 2.4 m/pixel with a 1.3° field of view. The camera system has 13 panchromatic, broad and narrow-band filters in the 0.36 µm to 1.1 µm range, and provides stereo imaging capabilities. JANUS will also allow relating spectral, laser a']",,0.0,0.13636363636363635,0.803346062115564
